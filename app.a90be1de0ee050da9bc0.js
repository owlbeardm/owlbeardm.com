","(TODO:) Your shot slashes across your target’s ear, almost entirely severing the top third. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn. In addition the flopping of the detached portion will be very distracting, causing a penalty of –10% to his WS for d10/2 turns. After the battle and any usual Heal tests, an additional Hard (-20%) Heal test can be attempted for the purpose of successfully stitching the two parts of the ear back together. This second test does not restore your W characteristic any further. ","(TODO:) Your shot grazes your target’s scalp, causing blood to flow into his eyes, as per Cutting Damage to Head #4.

The scarring will be unattractive but will not reduce his Fel by any significant margin. ","(TODO:) Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, knocks out a couple of teeth, lacerates the tongue and exits through the opposite cheek. Your target will suffer a penalty of –20% to his WS until the arrow is removed, requiring a full action. If attempting it himself, your target must first pass a WP test. Failure simply means the arrow remains. After the arrow is removed, the target will spit blood and teeth but suffer only –10% to his WS for the duration of the battle due to pain and the blood trickling down his throat. The tongue and the holes in his cheeks will heal naturally although he’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to any Fel tests requiring speech until his W characteristic is fully restored.

Until the arrow/bolt is removed all the target’s tests count as Hard (-20%). Removal requires either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test. Failure means a major artery was nicked during the removal process and either magical healing or another Hard (-20%) Heal test will be required to save him from bleeding to death within d10 turns.

Your target will be at –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to blood and bone fragments filling his mouth and nose. He is also stunned for d10 turns and must pass a WP test or gain one IP extra due to the horrifying experience of seeing an arrow sticking from his face. Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests.

Your target can no longer either open or close his mouth properly and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the arrow/bolt is removed, due to extreme pain and the blood filling his mouth. Removal will require a Challenging (-10%) Heal test or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test, taking three full actions. Failure means the arrow remains and a new test cannot be performed until the next day.

This takes two full actions and requires a successful Heal test or a Hard (-20%) Ag test. Failure means the shaft broke but the head of the arrow remains lodged in your target’s ribcage, now instead requiring a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test and six full actions to remove.","(TODO:) Your shot pierces your target’s side, penetrating the wall of muscle and entering his abdominal cavity but missing any internal organs. Your target suffers a –20% penalty to his WS until the arrow/bolt is removed, requiring two full actions and a successful Heal test or a Challenging (-10%) Ag test. Failure means that the projectile was successfully withdrawn but additional damage was caused, delaying healing, resulting in the target regaining one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W. In addition to delayed healing, the target must pass a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer an infection within one day, making him delirious and helpless for d10 days. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks into your target’s shoulder (roll d10: 1-5 right, 6-10 left) near the neck, barely missing the top of the lung. Due to the discomfort of having an arrow/bolt sticking out of his body, your target suffers a penalty of – 20% to his WS when using that arm, until the projectile is removed. Unfortunately, the point is lodged deep underneath the collarbone, requiring six full turns and either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test to avoid puncturing the lung. If this happens, the target suffers a cumulative –5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reach zero and expiring within another 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks into the target’s belly, felling him to the ground. The projectile has lacerated the intestines, spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. Your target is stunned, requiring a Hard (-20%) WP test to recover from the stunning.

In addition, he must make a Very Hard (-30%) T test or die from infection in d10 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing seals up the lacerations within half that time. Alternatively, a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent can be attempted, reducing the difficulty level to merely Hard (-20%) if a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is first performed.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks deep into your target’s stomach just beneath the ribs on his left side and damages the spleen, causing internal bleeding.

In addition, penalties until the projectile is removed and subsequent risk of infection is as for #6 above. Fortunately, the bleeding will be brought to a halt by the tough membranous covering of the spleen, containing the damage before your target dies from loss of blood.","(TODO:) Your shot splits your target’s breastbone but loses momentum before piercing his heart.

He must pass an immediate Hard (-20%) T test to stay conscious, otherwise suffering a penalty of –30% to all tests, and will also suffer a 20% risk of dying each turn, until magical healing is provided. If he survives, the penalty will be reduced by 10% each week as the lung gradually expands again.","(TODO:) Your shot tears through your target’s chest, damaging the aorta where it connects to the heart. The massive loss of blood causes a cumulative penalty of –20% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, then also suffering a cumulative 20% chance of dying each turn as his heart futilely empties his system of blood. Only a Very Hard magical healing spell test can save his life.","(TODO:) Your shot tears out through your target’s back, lacerating his liver, severing his abdominal aorta, damaging the spinal cord and felling him helpless to the ground, coughing up blood and bilious fluid.

He also loses use of the arm until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which requires a full action (half an action to break off the head, another to pull the shaft out) either by himself or someone else, plus a successful Challenging (-10%) WP test if he does it himself, gritting his teeth against the pain. ","(TODO:) Your shot slices the back of your target’s hand, severing tendons and nicking the metacarpal bones between the wrist and fingers. He can still flex his fingers, so he doesn’t drop his weapon, but the distracting sight of twitching tendons and white bone causes a penalty of – 20% to his WS until the end of his next turn.

This requires either a successful Heal test or, if lacking that skill, a Hard (-20%) Ag test, by someone else. Failure means the head was successfully withdrawn but additional damage means healing is delayed, the target recovering one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W.

","(TODO:) A large piece of shrapnel severs the top end of your target's biceps from the shoulder, leaving the muscle flopping like a big firm lump inside the skin of the arm near his elbow. Unless the muscle is successfully stitched back together within d10 days, requiring either magical healing or a successful Challenging (-10%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent plus four weeks of rest, he’ll suffer a permanent penalty of –20% to WS and S for any tasks performed with that arm in the future due to not being able to flex the arm well. ","(TODO:) Shrapnel rips through your target's upper arm, nicking a large artery. The spurts of blood cause a cumulative penalty of -5% to your target's WS, BS, Ag and S each turn until it has been tightly bandaged, requiring two full turns. A successful Hard (-20%) Ag test is also required if he does it himself, using one hand and his teeth. Otherwise he'll fall unconscious from loss of blood when any of those characteristics reaches zero. The wound will clot before he expires, however. ","(TODO:) A blast of fragments rips the flesh from your target's forearm and fractures one of the long bones, stunning him for d10 turns with pain and shock at such a ghastly sight. Only a Very Hard (-30%) magical healing spell test will save the arm, otherwise requiring amputation. ","(TODO:) A piece of shrapnel tears through the shoulder, ricocheting from bone into the chest and lacerating the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm.

He’ll suffer a penalty of –2 to his M and –20% to all Dodge Blow tests until it is removed, either by magical healing or a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent. If the latter is used, the target must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or suffer an infection that will force amputation unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is performed. If the infection goes untreated and the leg remains attached, gangrene and sepsis will occur within d10/2 days, causing death within another TB days.

","(TODO:) A blast of shrapnel tears away chunks of flesh from your target’s calf, causing gaping wounds and fracturing the fibula, the outer of the two long bones in the lower leg, forcing him to pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test or fall to the ground. Your target’s M will be reduced to 1 as he hobbles along, counting any Dodge Blow tests as Very Hard (-30%) until the end of the battle. A combination of infection, severed blood vessels and just plain, massive loss of tissue means the leg will never heal properly, giving a permanent penalty of –2 to M and –20% to any Dodge Blow tests.

The target is helpless with pain and shock for d10 turns, gaining one extra IP as a result of the view of his mangled leg and groin, should he survive. Loss of blood will mean he loses unconsciousness after an additional d10 turns, and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until he does. Only very limited function will remain to the leg afterward, reducing M to 1 and causing all Dodge Blow tests to count as Very Hard (-30%), although he can use crutches as per Bullet Damage to Leg #10.

The huge spurts of bright, red blood will cause a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, the target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless magically healed or rapidly aided by a pressure bandage, requiring a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test and two full turns, death will occur within another d10 turns.

The hand is useless until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless the wrist has been properly set with a successful Heal test within the first week, he will then suffer a penalty of -10% to WS tests or tests requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand afterward due to improperly set bones. Magical healing will automatically do this, as well as speeding up the healing process, ignoring the month required.

He must pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test or break his neck as he lands, killing him. If he passes he is still knocked unconscious. If the GM judges that such a throw is completely unlikely, such as if he very considerably outweighs you, or has a very low centre of gravity (think Dwarf in plate!), or your legs are crippled, then you instead manage to get him so off balance that he is still hurled to the ground and knocked unconscious, perhaps tripping him up as he stumbles past you.

Your opponent is stunned until he can pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test, getting his first attempt at the beginning of his next turn, re-rolling each turn until he succeeds. The pain from the broken bones halves his M and makes all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless properly set with a successful Heal test during the first week, the bones will heal badly, causing a permanent penalty of –1 to M and making all future Dodge Blow tests count as Challenging (-10%). Magical healing will correct this, as well as ignore the time required to heal the bones. ","(TODO:) You break your opponent’s ankle, knocking him to the ground. He is stunned for d10/2 turns and cannot use the leg until the fracture has healed in three weeks.

Your opponent falls to the ground and is stunned for d10 turns, afterward being unable to use the leg and suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests until the kneecap is popped back into place. This requires a successful Heal test, and probably a couple of strong helpers to hold the screaming patient down as the healer performs this very painful manoeuvre.

Ligaments inside the knee have snapped, making the joint unstable. Your opponent is stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty –10% to all tests for the duration of the combat, as well as suffering a permanent penalty of –2 to M and counting all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) from now on. Only magical healing can restore full function to the leg. ","(TODO:) A brutal kick to your opponent’s groin doubles him over, retching and helpless with pain for d10 turns. In addition, he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to all tests for the duration of the battle and will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or have his testicles ruptured, making him permanently sterile.

He’ll have to pass an Average T test or fall unconscious from the pain. If successful, he suffers a penalty of –30% to all tests for the duration of the battle, the penalty reduced by one third per week of rest. Regardless, the leg is useless and will probably never heal properly. M is permanently reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%) from now on. Proper healing will require either two months in traction, lying in bed with the leg held up and stretched by weights, under supervision of someone with the Surgery Talent, or magical healing, the latter counting as a Hard (-20%) spell test due to damage to nerves and small blood vessels supplying the joint. ","(TODO:) You shatter your opponent’s shinbone, fragments spearing through the skin. Your opponent falls to the ground, helpless and blind with pain for d10 turns, then suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Such an open fracture is very serious, almost always resulting in gangrene and infection. He'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer infection within d10 days, causing death in another d10 days unless amputation is performed.

shot nicks your target’s ear, causing a –10% penalty to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot grazes your target’s cheek, slicing open a wound that bleeds far more freely than expected. He’ll lose one attack or free parry on his next turn as he clasps one hand to his face. ","Your shot grazes your target’s neck, causing him to flinch and suffer a penalty of –20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot slashes across your target’s ear, almost entirely severing the top third. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn. In addition the flopping of the detached portion will be very distracting, causing a penalty of –10% to his WS for d10/2 turns. After the battle and any usual Heal tests, an additional Hard (-20%) Heal test can be attempted for the purpose of successfully stitching the two parts of the ear back together. This second test does not restore your W characteristic any further. ","Your shot grazes your target’s scalp, causing blood to flow into his eyes, as per Cutting Damage to Head #4. ","Your shot tears a furrow along your target’s jaw, exposing white bone and teeth. He is stunned until he can pass either a WP or T test, starting to roll on the turn after his next. The scarring will be unattractive but will not reduce his Fel by any significant margin. ","Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, knocks out a couple of teeth, lacerates the tongue and exits through the opposite cheek. Your target will suffer a penalty of –20% to his WS until the arrow is removed, requiring a full action. If attempting it himself, your target must first pass a WP test. Failure simply means the arrow remains. After the arrow is removed, the target will spit blood and teeth but suffer only –10% to his WS for the duration of the battle due to pain and the blood trickling down his throat. The tongue and the holes in his cheeks will heal naturally although he’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to any Fel tests requiring speech until his W characteristic is fully restored. ","Your shot enters through your target’s neck, burying itself to the fletching. Surprisingly, there is very little blood, the arrow/bolt apparently having missed the major arteries or veins. Until the arrow/bolt is removed all the target’s tests count as Hard (-20%). Removal requires either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test. Failure means a major artery was nicked during the removal process and either magical healing or another Hard (-20%) Heal test will be required to save him from bleeding to death within d10 turns. ","Your shot enters your opponent’s cheek near the nose and drives on into the nasal cavity, crumpling the thin walls to the nearby sinus. Your target will be at –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to blood and bone fragments filling his mouth and nose. He is also stunned for d10 turns and must pass a WP test or gain one IP extra due to the horrifying experience of seeing an arrow sticking from his face. Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests. ","Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, shattering a couple of upper molars and lodging in the mandibular joint between the upper and lower jaw. Your target can no longer either open or close his mouth properly and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the arrow/bolt is removed, due to extreme pain and the blood filling his mouth. Removal will require a Challenging (-10%) Heal test or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test, taking three full actions. Failure means the arrow remains and a new test cannot be performed until the next day. ","Your shot punctures one of your target’s eyeballs, lodging in the bony orbit and causing a clear gelatinous substance to run down his face. The target is stunned until the end of the battle. No amount of mundane or magical healing can restore the eye and he suffers reduction of any BS or sightbased Perception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter. ","Your shot pierces your target’s forehead, penetrating the skull by about an inch or two and damaging one frontal lobe of the brain. The target is stunned for d10 turns. He must then pass a Hard (-20%) T test or fall unconscious. If he passes he will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the end of the battle and must then pass an additional Hard (-20%) T test or suffer a lethal infection, making him delirious and helpless within one day, killing him within d10/2 days. A Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection. Survival will reduce his Fel by –20% due to personality changes and he will also gain a random Insanity. ","Your shot enters through one eye, penetrating into the brain and knocking your target unconscious. Death ensues within d10/2 turns unless magical healing is provided, counting as a Very Hard (-30%) spell test. Survival will mean the head of the arrow/bolt remains inside his skull and he will suffer a penalty of –20% to WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel for the rest of his life due to brain damage. ","Your shot slams into your target, coming out through the back of his neck. There is a 25% chance the shot went in through the mouth, turning him into a gruesome sight indeed and severing the spinal cord on the way out, otherwise going in through the throat and severing a carotid artery in a gush of blood. Either way, the target falls to the ground and gurgles for d10/2 turns before dying inevitably. ","Your shot spits your target’s head like an apple, killing him instantly, although his body will continue to twitch a bit for d10/2 turns."],Body:["Your shot grazes your target’s side, causing him to flinch and suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn.","Your shot slices along one rib, slicing the skin to the bone, causing a penalty of –20% to your target’s WS until the end of his next turn.","Your shot pierces your target’s flank just beneath the skin, the arrow/bolt sticking there and causing a penalty of – 20% to his WS until the end of his next turn, the penalty then reduced to –10% until the projectile is removed, requiring a full action (one half-action to break off the shaft, another half-action to withdraw the stump).","Your shot clips your target’s shoulder, knocking him to the ground.","Your shot lodges under a rib, causing your target intense pain every time he moves, making him suffer a –10% penalty to his WS until the arrow/bolt is removed. This takes two full actions and requires a successful Heal test or a Hard (-20%) Ag test. Failure means the shaft broke but the head of the arrow remains lodged in your target’s ribcage, now instead requiring a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test and six full actions to remove.","Your shot pierces your target’s side, penetrating the wall of muscle and entering his abdominal cavity but missing any internal organs. Your target suffers a –20% penalty to his WS until the arrow/bolt is removed, requiring two full actions and a successful Heal test or a Challenging (-10%) Ag test. Failure means that the projectile was successfully withdrawn but additional damage was caused, delaying healing, resulting in the target regaining one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W. In addition to delayed healing, the target must pass a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer an infection within one day, making him delirious and helpless for d10 days. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection.","Your shot sinks into your target’s shoulder (roll d10: 1-5 right, 6-10 left) near the neck, barely missing the top of the lung. Due to the discomfort of having an arrow/bolt sticking out of his body, your target suffers a penalty of – 20% to his WS when using that arm, until the projectile is removed. Unfortunately, the point is lodged deep underneath the collarbone, requiring six full turns and either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test to avoid puncturing the lung. If this happens, the target suffers a cumulative –5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reach zero and expiring within another 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided.","Your shot sinks into the target’s belly, felling him to the ground. The projectile has lacerated the intestines, spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. Your target is stunned, requiring a Hard (-20%) WP test to recover from the stunning. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, he’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to all tests. Removing the arrow requires three full actions and either a successful Heal test or a Challenging (-10%) Ag test. In addition, he must make a Very Hard (-30%) T test or die from infection in d10 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing seals up the lacerations within half that time. Alternatively, a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent can be attempted, reducing the difficulty level to merely Hard (-20%) if a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is first performed.","Your shot sinks deep into your target’s stomach just beneath the ribs on his left side and damages the spleen, causing internal bleeding. He is stunned until the end of his next turn and will then suffer a cumulative penalty of – 5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. In addition, penalties until the projectile is removed and subsequent risk of infection is as for #6 above. Fortunately, the bleeding will be brought to a halt by the tough membranous covering of the spleen, containing the damage before your target dies from loss of blood.","Your shot splits your target’s breastbone but loses momentum before piercing his heart. The intense pain makes your opponent helpless until he can pass a Hard (-20%) T test, reducing it to stunning, requiring another test to recover from that. He can start rolling for those tests at the end of his next turn.","Your shot penetrates between your target’s lower ribs, damaging a kidney. The massive bleeding causes a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless magically healed, he will die from loss of blood in another d10 turns. If he survives the arrow/bolt will need to be removed as for #6 above.","Your shot penetrates your target’s chest, collapsing one lung. He must pass an immediate Hard (-20%) T test to stay conscious, otherwise suffering a penalty of –30% to all tests, and will also suffer a 20% risk of dying each turn, until magical healing is provided. If he survives, the penalty will be reduced by 10% each week as the lung gradually expands again.","Your shot tears through your target’s chest, damaging the aorta where it connects to the heart. The massive loss of blood causes a cumulative penalty of –20% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, then also suffering a cumulative 20% chance of dying each turn as his heart futilely empties his system of blood. Only a Very Hard magical healing spell test can save his life.","Your shot tears out through your target’s back, lacerating his liver, severing his abdominal aorta, damaging the spinal cord and felling him helpless to the ground, coughing up blood and bilious fluid. Death is inevitable in d10/2 turns.","Your shot transfixes your target’s heart, killing him instantly"],Arms:["Your shot grazes your target’s hand, forcing him to pass a WP test or drop anything he is holding in that hand. ","Your shot nicks the wrist of your target, causing a small but vicious wound. Due to the pain, he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot glances off your target’s elbow, sending an electric shock of pain down his arm, making him drop anything he is holding in that hand. The arm is numb and useless for d10/2 turns. ","Your shot slices your target’s biceps, exposing red, glistening muscle tissue. He suffers a penalty of –20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot penetrates the large muscle connecting your target’s shoulder to the upper arm, the arrow/bolt remaining in the wound with the point sticking out the other side. He must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. He also loses use of the arm until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which requires a full action (half an action to break off the head, another to pull the shaft out) either by himself or someone else, plus a successful Challenging (-10%) WP test if he does it himself, gritting his teeth against the pain. ","Your shot slices the back of your target’s hand, severing tendons and nicking the metacarpal bones between the wrist and fingers. He can still flex his fingers, so he doesn’t drop his weapon, but the distracting sight of twitching tendons and white bone causes a penalty of – 20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. Unless magically healed he’ll suffer a permanent –10% penalty to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand due to decreased manual dexterity from not being able to open his hand properly. ","Your shot transfixes your target’s hand, passing between the metacarpal bones between wrist and fingers, and nailing it to any shield he might be holding in that hand. Until the arrow is removed, as per #5 above, the hand is useless. He also counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and, unless magically healed, will suffer a permanent –5% penalty to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand, due to nerve damage to his middle finger.","Your shot transfixes your target’s wrist, resulting in penalties as for #7 above, except that you must pass a WP test to recover from the stunning and the penalty will be – 20% due to the much greater damage to nerves and tendons. ","Your shot penetrates your target’s forearm, the point lodging in one of the long bones of the forearm. Your target is stunned for d10/2 turns. The arm is useless until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which is very difficult due to the head being firmly embedded in the bone, requiring three full actions either by you or someone else, plus a successful Hard (-20%) WP test if you do it yourself. ","Your shot lodges in your target’s elbow, severing the head of one of the long bones of the forearm and jamming the joint at a 90-degree angle. Your target is stunned by blinding pain for d10/2 turns and the arm is useless until his W characteristic has been fully recovered. Also the head of the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn. This requires either a successful Heal test or, if lacking that skill, a Hard (-20%) Ag test, by someone else. Failure means the head was successfully withdrawn but additional damage means healing is delayed, the target recovering one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W. ","Your shot lacerates the target’s biceps muscle, also severing the large artery in the arm. Due to the spurting arterial spray, he will suffer a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, losing consciousness when any of those characteristics reaches zero. When he wakes up the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn as per #5 above. ","Your shot pierces the meaty part of your target’s shoulder near the neck, damaging the brachial plexus, the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm. He must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. Unless magically healed within one day, which will count as a Hard (-20%) spell test, the paralysis will be permanent, rendering the arm limp and useless. Also, the arrow/bolt will have to be removed as per #10 above. ","Your shot shatters your target’s shoulder-blade and severs the large artery branching off from the aorta to the arm and neck, causing massive internal bleeding. An immediate Hard (-20%) T test is required to avoid falling unconscious. He also suffers a cumulative 10% risk of dying from loss of blood each turn, unless magically healed. If he survives, the arrow/bolt will have to be removed as per #10 above. ","Your shot enters your target’s shoulder at an angle and exits through his neck in a spray of blood. Your target sways uncertainly for a moment before his legs buckle and he collapses to the ground, unconscious. Death is inevitable within d10/2 rounds. ","Your shot enters through your target’s armpit, embedding itself to the fletching. Your target crumples to the ground, gasping and gurgling for one turn while a soft, sucking noise emanates from the wound, before everything is still."],Legs:["Your shot grazes your target’s foot, causing a small but painful wound. He suffers a penalty of –10% to WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot grazes your target’s ankle, causing him to stumble, losing one attack or free parry on his next turn as he flails his arms. ","Your shot glances off your target’s shin. For the next d10/2 turns his M is halved, all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) and he may take no attack actions as he limps and gasps from the pain. ","Your shot slams into your target’s kneecap, penetrating about half an inch before tearing out again as the shaft whips around, sending the arrow/bolt spinning crazily through the air. The target is stunned until the end of his next turn and must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or drop his weapon. ","Your shot slices a furrow along your target’s hip. Distracted by the pain and forced to guard his injured side, your target suffers a penalty of –10% to all tests for d10 turns. ","Your shot slices across the back of your target’s foot, severing tendons to the toes. The target is stunned until the end of his next turn, then suffers a –2 penalty to his M as well as counting all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) until the end of the battle, as his toes won’t obey him properly, making footing awkward. Unless magical or surgical healing is provided within d10/2 days, M will be permanently reduced by –1. ","Your shot transfixes the target’s foot, pinning it to the ground. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, M is reduced to zero, all WS tests count as Challenging (–10%) and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%). Removal requires two full turns and use of both hands. ","Your shot transfixes your target’s calf, fracturing the outer of the two bones of the lower leg. Until the end of the battle all tests are counted as Hard (-20%) due to the blinding pain. In addition, until the target’s W characteristic is fully restored, M is reduced by –2 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%). Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests. ","Your shot slams through your target’s knee, the point tearing out the back of the joint. Until the projectile has been removed from the jammed knee, M is reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%). Removing the arrow/bolt takes three full actions. Fragments of bone left inside the joint causes the knee to stiffen up and lock itself at inopportune moments, causing  a permanent –1 penalty to M and making all Dodge Blow tests count as Challenging (-10%). ","Your shot shatters your target’s shinbone, knocking him to the ground writhing in pain. He counts as helpless for d10/2 turns and is unable to support himself on that leg until the fracture has healed in six weeks. Hopping on one leg counts as having a Move of 1 and all WS and Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%). One crutch reduces the difficulty of the tests to Hard (-20%) but requires the use of one hand. Two crutches enables you to limp along at a Move of 2 but requires both hands and Dodge Blow tests still count as Hard (-20%). ","Your shot shatters your target’s kneecap, knocking him to the ground. He is helpless with pain for d10 turns. He remains unable to support himself on that leg until his W characteristic is restored fully. M is permanently reduced by –2 and all Dodge Blow tests will count as Challenging (-10%) from now on. ","Your shot sinks deep into the target’s thigh, cracking the thighbone. Your target falls to the ground, clasping his leg in agony, counting as helpless for d10 turns, then suffers a penalty of –20% to all tests for the duration of the battle due to the agonizing pain. Subsequent penalties and healing are as per #10 above. ","Your shot sinks into the target’s thigh, severing the large femoral artery. Your target will suffer a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. He’ll then die from loss of blood in another d10/2 turns unless magical healing is provided. ","Your shot slams into your target’s hip, shattering bone and lacerating nerves and major blood vessels inside the pelvis. Your target falls to the ground, helpless with shock, and expires inevitably in d10/2 turns. ","Your shot shatters the femur and lays open the femoral artery, causing your target to fall unconscious to the ground and die inevitably in d10/2 turns in a bright pumping spray of arterial blood. "]},Blunt:{Head:["Your weapon glances off the side of your opponent’s head, making a ringing noise and reducing his next attack or parry by a penalty of –10%. ","Your blow glances off your opponent’s cheekbone, making him lose one attack or free parry on his next turn and giving him a black eye. ","Your weapon glances off the bridge of your opponent’s nose, making him see bright flashes and his eyes water. All his WS tests during the next d10/2 turns will count as Challenging (-10%). ","Your weapon smashes into the meat of your opponent’s neck, straining the large neck muscles. All his WS tests during the next d10/2 turns will count as Hard (-20%). ","Your weapon lands a solid blow on the side of your opponent’s head, bursting his eardrum, making a small rivulet of blood run down his neck. He will be stunned until the end of his next turn and will suffer a penalty of – 20% to all hearing-based Perception tests until the eardrum has resealed itself in d10/2 weeks. ","Your blow connects to your opponent’s head with a sickening thud. Concussed, he falls to the ground, counting as helpless until he can make a Hard (-20%) T test to regain full consciousness, starting to roll during his next turn, re-rolling each turn until he succeeds. For the rest of this battle he will suffer a –10% penalty to his WS, BS and Ag due to dizziness and nausea. He must also make a Challenging (-10%) test or suffer short-term amnesia, not remembering a thing about the battle or how he ended up in it. ","Your weapon fractures your opponent’s nose, stunning him until the end of his next turn as he sees bright flashes and spits blood. On his next turn after that he must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test to recover, re-rolling each turn until he succeeds. There is a 50% chance that the nose will be so smashed it reduces his Fel by d10% unless magically healed or set with a successful Heal test by someone with the Surgery Talent. ","Your blow crashes into your opponent’s skull, stunning him until the end of his next turn. On his next turn after that he must pass a Hard (-20%) T test to recover, rerolling each turn until he succeeds. The blow has fractured his skull, causing a splinter of bone to press into his brain and starting a slow bleeding between the brain and the skull that will keep expanding, eventually killing him unless pressure is relieved. He’ll suffer a cumulative penalty of –5% to his WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel every two hours, falling into a coma when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying within another d10/2 days. The only effective cure is a procedure called trepanation, which involves removing a piece of the skull by drilling or boring into it, thus relieving the pressure and allowing access to remove the splinter. This requires at least one hour and a Challenging (-10%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent. If successful, a metal plate of some kind, usually a silver coin that has been hammered flat and polished, is used to cover the hole, nailed directly to the surrounding bone and then covered with a flap of the scalp.

Two crutches enables you to limp along at a Move of 2 but requires both hands and Dodge Blow tests still count as Hard (-20%). ","Your bullet smashes into your target’s hip, lodging in the smashed joint. The hipbone is badly fractured and the pelvis chipped, dropping the target to the ground, helpless with pain for d10/2 turns. The leg is useless until the fracture has healed in six weeks.

Some stiffness will remain, causing a penalty of –10% to any WS tests made with that arm, unless magically healed. Alternatively, the magical healing can be replaced with a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent, halving the penalty. ","Fragments smash into your target's shoulder, fracturing the collarbone and tearing up some chest muscles. Your target will be stunned for d10/2 turns and suffer a penalty of -20% to both WS and S for any tests or blows made with that arm until the fracture has healed in d10/2 weeks. ","A large piece of shrapnel severs the top end of your target's biceps from the shoulder, leaving the muscle flopping like a big firm lump inside the skin of the arm near his elbow. Unless the muscle is successfully stitched back together within d10 days, requiring either magical healing or a successful Challenging (-10%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent plus four weeks of rest, he’ll suffer a permanent penalty of –20% to WS and S for any tasks performed with that arm in the future due to not being able to flex the arm well. ","Shrapnel rips through your target's upper arm, nicking a large artery. The spurts of blood cause a cumulative penalty of -5% to your target's WS, BS, Ag and S each turn until it has been tightly bandaged, requiring two full turns. A successful Hard (-20%) Ag test is also required if he does it himself, using one hand and his teeth. Otherwise he'll fall unconscious from loss of blood when any of those characteristics reaches zero. The wound will clot before he expires, however. ","A blast of fragments rips the flesh from your target's forearm and fractures one of the long bones, stunning him for d10 turns with pain and shock at such a ghastly sight. Only a Very Hard (-30%) magical healing spell test will save the arm, otherwise requiring amputation. ","A piece of shrapnel tears through the shoulder, ricocheting from bone into the chest and lacerating the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm. The arm will be permanently paralysed and useless. Your target will have to pass an immediate Hard (-20%) T test or fall unconscious from shock. ","A large chunk of shrapnel smashes through the collarbone and upper ribs, bouncing against the back of the shoulderblade before severing the large artery branching off from the aorta to the arm. A pumping spray of blood rises up from the wound in your target's shoulder near the neck, sending him into unconsciousness to die inevitably in a spreading pool of blood within d10/2 turns. ","A burst of shrapnel practically tears the target’s arm from its socket. Blood gushes out in huge spurts. Massive shock and loss of blood causes instant unconsciousness and a mercifully quick death within two turns. "],Legs:["Shrapnel or pellets graze your target’s foot, causing a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Fragments pierce your target’s calf, causing any Dodge Blow tests to count as Challenging (-10%) for the rest of the battle. ","Chunks of shrapnel strike your target’s thigh, bruising but not penetrating, forcing him to pass a Challenging (-10%) Ag test or be knocked to the ground. ","A piece of shrapnel painfully lodges in your target’s kneecap. The target is stunned until the end of his next turn and must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or drop his weapon to clasp his knee. ","Pieces of shrapnel tear several long, shallow furrows along your target’s hip. Distracted by the pain and forced to guard his injured side, your target is at –10% to all tests for d10 turns. ","A pellet lodges inside your target’s knee, forcing him to make a Hard (-20%) Ag test or fall down. He’ll suffer a penalty of –2 to his M and –20% to all Dodge Blow tests until it is removed, either by magical healing or a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent. If the latter is used, the target must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or suffer an infection that will force amputation unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is performed. If the infection goes untreated and the leg remains attached, gangrene and sepsis will occur within d10/2 days, causing death within another TB days. ","A sharp fragment lacerates your target’s inner thigh near the groin, stunning him for d10/2 turns. If male, he must also pass an Average T test or be emasculated for the rest of his life. ","A blast of shrapnel tears away chunks of flesh from your target’s calf, causing gaping wounds and fracturing the fibula, the outer of the two long bones in the lower leg, forcing him to pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test or fall to the ground. Your target’s M will be reduced to 1 as he hobbles along, counting any Dodge Blow tests as Very Hard (-30%) until the end of the battle. A combination of infection, severed blood vessels and just plain, massive loss of tissue means the leg will never heal properly, giving a permanent penalty of –2 to M and –20% to any Dodge Blow tests. ","Shrapnel shreds your target’s knee, utterly destroying the kneecap and penetrating into the joint, shredding bone and ligaments as it goes along. He falls to the ground, screaming and stunned for d10 turns. Unless magical healing is provided within d10 days, the leg will have to be amputated. Otherwise it’ll still be stiff and unbending, causing permanent penalties as per #8 above. ","A large piece of shrapnel pierces your target’s thigh, tearing out of the back of the leg in a spray of blood, leaving a huge flap of muscle gruesomely flapping. The blast knocks him to the ground, unable to get up. Loss of blood will cause a cumulative –5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, the target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless the leg is tightly bandaged, requiring someone else’s help and three full turns, death will occur within another 2d10 turns. ","Fragments tear into the hip joint, causing nerve damage that leaves the whole leg limp and useless, totally paralysed. Your target falls to the ground, stunned for d10 turns and unable to get up. Two crutches will be necessary to get around properly in the future, unless he wants to hop around on one leg. ","An utterly hideous storm of fragments tears across your target’s upper thigh near the hip joint, ripping apart his genitals and laying the thigh open to the bone. The target is helpless with pain and shock for d10 turns, gaining one extra IP as a result of the view of his mangled leg and groin, should he survive. Loss of blood will mean he loses unconsciousness after an additional d10 turns, and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until he does. Only very limited function will remain to the leg afterward, reducing M to 1 and causing all Dodge Blow tests to count as Very Hard (-30%), although he can use crutches as per Bullet Damage to Leg #10. ","A jagged piece of metal lays open your target’s inner thigh, severing the femoral artery. The huge spurts of bright, red blood will cause a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, the target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless magically healed or rapidly aided by a pressure bandage, requiring a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test and two full turns, death will occur within another d10 turns. ","A blast of shrapnel blows the leg off at the knee, leaving it hanging by a shred. Your target falls to the ground, helpless and with blood spurting from the stump. Death occurs from loss of blood within d10 turns unless magical healing or a tourniquet, requiring two full turns and someone else’s help, is provided, neither of which will save the leg. ","A blast of shrapnel nearly tears the leg out of its socket, leaving a gaping hole with the thighbone and spurting arteries clearly visible. Your target falls immediately unconscious from shock, dying inevitably in d10/2 turns. "]},Unarmed:{Head:["A glancing punch to the face causes your opponent to stumble backward.

","A vicious punch crumples your opponent’s cheekbone, causing a penalty of –20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","You jam a finger up your opponent’s nostril, tearing the sensitive flesh as you savagely rip the finger out, stunning your opponent until the end of his next turn. ","You slam a blow against your opponent’s ear, stunning him until the end of his next turn and reducing by half any hearing-related Perception tests for the rest of the day. ","You badly rip one of your opponent’s ears, almost tearing it off. The pain forces him to pass an Average WP test or be stunned until the end of his next turn. The dangling ear distracts him so badly he suffers a penalty of –5% to his WS for the duration of the battle. It might heal a bit crooked but not badly enough to cause any permanent reduction of Fel. ","A blow to the mouth fractures several teeth. Your opponent is stunned until the end of his next turn and must then pass an Average WP test to recover, beginning to roll at the start of his next turn after that. Unless he already has missing or unsightly teeth (GM’s call), his Fel is permanently reduced by –5%. ","You punch your opponent in the throat, momentarily cutting off his airways as the windpipe spasms. He suffers a penalty of –15% to all tests until the end of his next turn, reducing the penalty to –10% the turn after that, finally reducing it to –5% for one final turn before fully recovering. ","A powerful punch mashes one side of your opponent’s face, giving him a magnificent black eye and fracturing the cheekbone. He must pass a Routine (+10%) T test or be knocked unconscious. If he is wearing a helmet with decent face protection (GM’s call) the test counts as Easy (+20%) instead. If successful, he is instead knocked to the ground. Regardless, his Fel is reduced by –5% until the swelling and bruising has gone away in two weeks. ","You headbutt your opponent, mashing his nose. He is stunned for d10/2 turns as he sees stars and flashes. He'll develop two lovely shiners, reducing his Fel by -10% until the swelling and bruising has gone away in two weeks. If you are wearing a helmet and your opponent is not, add +1 turn to his stunning. If he is wearing a helmet and you are not, halve the number of turns. ","A powerful blow to your opponent’s chin breaks the jaw in several places. He must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or be knocked unconscious. If successful, he is stunned for d10/ 2 turns and then suffers a penalty of –10% to all actions for the duration of the battle. The jaw will have to be wired or tightly bandaged to heal, forcing your opponent to eat through a straw, also suffering a penalty of –15% to his Fel in any situation where it is important that he is heard clearly, for three weeks. ","You gouge one of your opponent’s eyes. He must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or lose the eye permanently, reducing by half all BS and sight-related Perception tests, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter. Regardless, he is helpless with pain for d10 turns and then suffers a penalty of –15% to all tests for the duration of the combat. ","You badly pummel your opponent’s head, fracturing his skull and causing bleeding inside his brain. He falls immediately unconscious and remains in a coma for d10 days. Afterward he must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or die, otherwise waking up with a penalty of –30% to WS, BS, Ag and Int, reducing the penalty by 10% per week until it stands at –10%, which is sadly permanent due to brain-damage. ","You crush your opponent’s windpipe, crumpling the cartilage of his larynx. He is stunned for TB turns before falling unconscious for lack of air, dying within another d10 turns unless saved by magical healing. ","You break your opponent’s neck, either with a mighty blow snapping his head back or by grabbing him by chin and the back of his head, violently twisting until a loud crack is heard. Death is instantaneous. Critical Hits – Unarmed Combat Damage "],Body:["Your opponent staggers backward and may not perform any attack actions during his next turn. ","A blow to the ribs just underneath the armpit staggers your opponent, causing him to suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn.

","You slam your opponent to the floor, knocking him down. ","A solid punch to the solar plexus slams the breath from your opponent’s body, stunning him until the end of his next turn. ","The sound of ribs creaking accompanies the whoosh of your opponent’s forcefully expelled breath as you knock him to the ground, stunned until the end of his next turn. ","You break a rib in your opponent’s side, causing him a penalty of –10% to all tests for the duration of the battle. The blow will also have caused a minor bleeding in the kidney of that side, badly scaring your opponent the next time he needs to relieve his bladder, as the urine takes on a deep red tinge. ","You go straight for your opponent’s groin in a manner most unfitting for a gentleman, stunning him for d10 turns as he gasps in agony. If your opponent is female or wearing a Plate Breastplate with reasonable groin protection (GM’s call but usually included, at least if part of a full suit of plate), halve the number of turns. ","A powerful blow to the chest stuns your opponent until the end of his next turn and makes his heart start beating irregularly. At the beginning of his next turn after that he’ll have to pass a Routine (+10%) T test to regain his normal rhythm or fall unconscious, in which case he’ll wake up again in d10 minutes as his heartbeat stabilizes. If successful, he’ll suffer no further ill effects. ","You savagely slam your fist or knee repeatedly against your opponent’s side over and over again, breaking several of his ribs and contusing the lung. He falls to the ground, spitting blood, helpless until the end of his next turn, all breath driven from his body. He then suffers a penalty of –20% to all actions for the duration of the combat. After the battle he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS, BS, Ag and S from Critical Hits – Unarmed Combat Damage the pain of fractured ribs grinding against each other, until his W characteristic is fully restored as his ribs slowly heal. ","You fracture several of the lower ribs on your opponent’s right side, the sharp fragments driving into his body and lacerating his liver. He is stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty of –15% to all actions for the duration of the combat. He’ll also have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or suffer serious internal bleeding. If successful, he’ll only suffer a penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S from the pain of fractured ribs grinding against each other, until his W characteristic is fully restored as his ribs slowly heal. Otherwise he’ll also suffer an additional cumulative penalty of an extra –5% per hour after the battle, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Fortunately, the bleeding will stop spontaneously thereafter and he’ll regain his characteristics at a rate of 10% per day (not counting the –10% penalty from the pain of the broken ribs) as his body replenishes the lost blood. ","A vicious blow to your opponent’s left side stuns him until the end of his next turn and ruptures his spleen. The longerterm results are as for Blunt Damage to Body #6. ","You pick your opponent up bodily and slam him into the ground. He’ll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or be knocked unconscious.

If the GM judges that this result is unlikely, even with the extra strength brought on by a surge of adrenaline, such as if your opponent is an Ogre or otherwise severely outweighs you, your opponent nevertheless still is thrown badly off balance and ends up on the floor, knocked down and counting as stunned for d10/2 turns. ","You slam either your fist or the heel of your foot into the upper part of your opponent's solar plexus, snapping the lower part of his breastbone. The fragment drives into his chest, lacerating the diaphragm muscles that he breathes with. He falls helplessly to his knees, gasping and helpless for d10 turns until he keels over unconscious. He'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or die in another 2d10 turns, otherwise suffering a permanent reduction of -15% to S and T due to reduced breathing capacity. If your opponent is wearing a breastplate he is instead hurled backwards, hitting his head as he lands, laying him out cold but otherwise very much alive and unhurt. ","You grab you opponent and with irresistible force slam him down on his back across your knee, breaking his spine. He must pass an immediate Very Hard (-30%) T test or die on the spot, otherwise becoming permanently paralysed from the waist down and counting as helpless from shock for the duration of the combat. If your opponent is wearing a Plate Breastplate with a backplate (GM's call but usually included, especially if part of a full suit of plate), then you would not be so foolish as to attempt this stunt and end up with a broken knee; count the result as #13 instead.

","You bruise your opponent’s upper arm, causing him to flinch. He may not perform any attack actions on his next turn. ","You manage to grab whatever your opponent is holding in that hand. Make an opposed S test, your opponent gaining a +20% bonus to his S if he is holding a shield or a twohanded weapon. If you beat him you have snatched it away and are now in possession of it.

If you fail, or if your opponent is holding nothing in that hand, the result is as per #1 above. ","You slam an elbow, fist or booted foot into your opponent’s biceps, bruising the muscle, causing a penalty of –10% to his WS and S for any tests or blows using that arm for the duration of the combat. ","You manage to grab and badly twist your opponent’s wrist, making him drop whatever he is holding in that hand. If he is holding nothing, then he is unable to use that hand for attacking and may not attempt to grapple for the next two turns. ","You smack your opponent in the elbow, hitting a nerve, sending a shock of sharp pain down the arm, making him drop anything held in that hand. He’ll have to pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or be stunned until the end of his next turn. The arm is paralysed and useless for d10/2 turns. ","You get hold of one of your opponent’s fingers, bending it backward savagely until the bone snaps. Your opponent counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and must pass a WP test each time he wants to perform any action with that hand for the duration of the battle. Setting the finger straight again and tying it to a small splint or a neighbouring finger is painful but easy, but your opponent will still suffer a penalty of –10% to any tasks, attacks or parries due to pain and swelling until the bone has started to heal properly in two weeks.

Your opponent is stunned until the end of his next turn and then suffers a penalty of –20% to any tests made with that arm until the fracture has healed in three weeks. ","You smash your opponent with a mighty blow, dislocating the shoulder from its socket. Your opponent is stunned until he can pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test, getting one attempt at the beginning of each of his turns. The whole arm is useless until popped back into place with a successful Heal test, afterward suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests performed with that arm until it has started to heal in one week, halving the penalty for another week before being restored to full function. ","You snap your opponent’s wrist, making the hand stand out at an odd angle. He must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or be stunned for d10/2 turns. The hand is useless until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless the wrist has been properly set with a successful Heal test within the first week, he will then suffer a penalty of -10% to WS tests or tests requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand afterward due to improperly set bones. Magical healing will automatically do this, as well as speeding up the healing process, ignoring the month required. ","You lock your opponent’s arm in a strong grip and then either twist it forcefully or bring up a knee to slam into the elbow joint, snapping the elbow with a loud crack. Your opponent is stunned for d10/2 turns and the arm useless until the fracture has healed in four weeks. ","You grab your opponent’s arm and twist around, throwing him across your hip. He lands heavily, knocked down and stunned for d10 turns. His shoulder is also dislocated as per #11 above. ","As your opponent swings at you, you grab his arm and use his momentum to drag him toward you, and then roll backward as you put a foot in his stomach, hurling him over your head. He must pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test or break his neck as he lands, killing him. If he passes he is still knocked unconscious. If the GM judges that such a throw is completely unlikely, such as if he very considerably outweighs you, or has a very low centre of gravity (think Dwarf in plate!), or your legs are crippled, then you instead manage to get him so off balance that he is still hurled to the ground and knocked unconscious, perhaps tripping him up as he stumbles past you. "],Legs:["A glancing blow hits your opponent’s shin, the pain causing a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","You strike your opponent on the inside of his thigh, barely missing his groin. He is knocked off balance and may not perform any attack actions on his next turn. ","A vicious blow against your opponent’s hip fails to break anything but causes him enough pain to reduce his WS by – 20% until the end of his next turn. ","You stomp down hard on your opponent’s toes. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn as he jumps up and down, wailing and cursing. ","You sweep your opponent’s leg, knocking him to the ground unless he can pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test. If successful, he may not perform any attack actions on his next turn. ","A powerful blow slams into your opponent’s hip, spinning him around and knocking him to the ground, dazed and stunned until the end of his next turn. ","You badly bruise your opponent’s thigh. He suffers a penalty of –1 to his M and counts all Dodge Blow tests as Challenging (-10%) for the duration of the battle. ","You strike a telling blow to your opponent’s knee. He must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or count as stunned for d10/2 turns. If successful, his M is halved and he counts all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) for an equal amount of time. ","You slam your heel down hard on your opponent’s foot, breaking some of the metatarsals, the bones between the ankle and the toes. Your opponent is stunned until he can pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test, getting his first attempt at the beginning of his next turn, re-rolling each turn until he succeeds. The pain from the broken bones halves his M and makes all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless properly set with a successful Heal test during the first week, the bones will heal badly, causing a permanent penalty of –1 to M and making all future Dodge Blow tests count as Challenging (-10%). Magical healing will correct this, as well as ignore the time required to heal the bones. ","You break your opponent’s ankle, knocking him to the ground. He is stunned for d10/2 turns and cannot use the leg until the fracture has healed in three weeks. If the ankle is not correctly set with a successful Heal test within the first week, it will heal crookedly and permanently reduce your opponent’s M by -1. ","Your blow pops your opponent’s kneecap, making it stand out like a bump underneath the skin to one side of the knee. This is extremely painful and effectively locks the joint. Your opponent falls to the ground and is stunned for d10 turns, afterward being unable to use the leg and suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests until the kneecap is popped back into place. This requires a successful Heal test, and probably a couple of strong helpers to hold the screaming patient down as the healer performs this very painful manoeuvre. (If your opponent is wearing Plate Leggings, this is an unlikely result and the hit instead counts as #8 above.) ","You slam a powerful blow into the side of your opponent’s knee, bending the knee inwards in a most painful and unnatural manner, popping something inside the joint. Ligaments inside the knee have snapped, making the joint unstable. Your opponent is stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty –10% to all tests for the duration of the combat, as well as suffering a permanent penalty of –2 to M and counting all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) from now on. Only magical healing can restore full function to the leg. ","A brutal kick to your opponent’s groin doubles him over, retching and helpless with pain for d10 turns. In addition, he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to all tests for the duration of the battle and will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or have his testicles ruptured, making him permanently sterile. If your opponent is female or wearing a Plate Breastplate with reasonable groin protection (GM’s call but usually included, at least if part of a full suit of plate), ignore this and simply count your opponent as stunned for d10 turns. ","You manage to dislocate your opponent’s hip and break off a fragment of the part of the pelvic bone forming the “cup” holding the head of the thighbone in place against the pelvis, leaving him screaming in agony on the ground. He’ll have to pass an Average T test or fall unconscious from the pain. If successful, he suffers a penalty of –30% to all tests for the duration of the battle, the penalty reduced by one third per week of rest. Regardless, the leg is useless and will probably never heal properly. M is permanently reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%) from now on. Proper healing will require either two months in traction, lying in bed with the leg held up and stretched by weights, under supervision of someone with the Surgery Talent, or magical healing, the latter counting as a Hard (-20%) spell test due to damage to nerves and small blood vessels supplying the joint. ","You shatter your opponent’s shinbone, fragments spearing through the skin. Your opponent falls to the ground, helpless and blind with pain for d10 turns, then suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Such an open fracture is very serious, almost always resulting in gangrene and infection. He'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer infection within d10 days, causing death in another d10 days unless amputation is performed. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will save his life but the leg will remain useless unless magically healed, which will require a Hard (-20%) spell test due to the mess of bone shards, damaged nerves and blood vessels inside the leg.
