The flow of blood into their eyes will cause a dazzled condition until they spend an action to wipe it away. Each turn after that they must attempt a DC 6 flat check or more blood will flow down, repeating the condition, possibly occurring again and again until somebody pass very easy (-5 to DC) Administer First Aid check to bandage the wound.","Your shot tears a furrow along your target\'s jaw, exposing white bone and teeth.

Your target will suffer a penalty of -4 to their attack rolls until the arrow is removed, requiring two actions. If attempting it themselves, your target must first pass a Will save. Failure simply means the arrow remains.

Surprisingly, there is very little blood, the arrow/bolt apparently having missed the major arteries or veins. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, target is sickened 2. Removal requires either a successful Medicine check with expert proficiency or a very hard (+5 to DC) Thievery or Athletics check.

Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special checks.","(TODO:10) Your shot enters through your target\'s cheek, shattering a couple of upper molars and lodging in the mandibular joint between the upper and lower jaw. Your target can no longer either open or close their mouth properly and will be sickened 5 until the arrow/bolt is removed, due to extreme pain and the blood filling their mouth. Removal will require a challenging (+1 to DC) Medicine check or a very hard (+5 to DC) Thievery or Athletics check, taking three actions. Failure means the arrow remains, and a new test cannot be performed within one hour.","(TODO:11) Your shot punctures one of your target\'s eyeballs, lodging in the bony orbit and causing a clear gelatinous substance to run down their face.

No amount of mundane or magical healing can restore the eye.","(TODO:12) Your shot pierces your target\'s forehead, penetrating the skull by about an inch or two and damaging one frontal lobe of the brain. The target is stunned for 1d6 turns. They must then pass a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or drop prone and be stunned for the rest of the battle. If they pass they will be sickened 5 until the end of the battle and must then pass an additional hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude test or suffer a lethal infection, making them delirious and helpless within one day, killing them within 1d4 days. Disease can be cured as normal.","(TODO:13) Your shot enters through one eye, penetrating into the brain and knocking your target prone and stunned. Death ensues within 1d4 turns unless magical healing is provided. To survive with healing target must pass a very hard (+5 to DC) Fortitude save or magic must be as strong as Breath of Life. Survival will mean the head of the arrow/bolt remains inside their skull, and they will suffer a penalty of -1 to all skill checks for the rest of their life due to brain damage unless it\'s recovered with powerful restoration or regeneration magic.","(TODO:14) Your shot slams into your target, coming out through the back of their neck. There is a 25% chance the shot went in through the mouth, turning them into a gruesome sight indeed and severing the spinal cord on the way out, otherwise going in through the throat and severing a carotid artery in a gush of blood. Either way, the target falls prone and gurgles for 1d4 turns before dying inevitably.","(TODO:15) Your shot spits your target\'s head like an apple, killing them instantly, although their body will continue to twitch a bit for 1d4 turns."],"Body":["Your shot grazes your target\'s side, causing them to flinch and suffer a penalty of -1 to their attack rolls until the end of their next turn.","Your shot slices along one rib, slicing the skin to the bone, causing a penalty of -2 to your target\'s attack rolls until the end of their next turn.","Your shot pierces your target\'s flank just beneath the skin, the arrow/bolt sticking there and causing a penalty of -2 to their attack rolls until the end of their next turn, the penalty then reduced to -1 until the projectile is removed, requiring an action (to break off the shaft and to withdraw the stump).","Your shot clips your target\'s shoulder, making them slowed 1 until the end of their next turn. They must pass a Fortitude save or be knocked prone.","Your shot lodges under a rib, causing your target intense pain every time they moves, making them suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls until it is removed. This takes an action and requires a successful Medicine check or a hard (+2 to DC) Reflex save. Failure means the shaft broke but the head of the arrow remains lodged in your target\'s ribcage, now instead requiring a successful hard (+2 to DC) Medicine check.","Your shot pierces your target\'s side, penetrating the wall of muscle and entering their abdominal cavity but missing any internal organs. Your target suffers a -4 penalty to their attack rolls until the arrow/bolt is removed, requiring an action and a successful Medicine check or a hard (+2 to DC) Reflex save. Failure means that the projectile was successfully withdrawn but additional damage was caused, delaying healing, meaning they\'ll recover only half of Hit Points next time they restore them. In addition to delayed healing, the target must pass a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or suffer a Tetanus within one day.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks into your target\'s shoulder (roll 1d6: 1-5 right, 6-10 left) near the neck, barely missing the top of the lung. Due to the discomfort of having an arrow/bolt sticking out of their body, your target suffers a penalty of -4 to their attack rolls when using that arm, until the projectile is removed. Unfortunately, the point is lodged deep underneath the collarbone, requiring six full turns and either a successful Medicine check with expert proficiency or a very hard (+5 to DC) Reflex save to avoid puncturing the lung. If this happens, the targeremoveh turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reach zero and expiring within another 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks into the target\'s belly, felling them prone. The projectile has lacerated the intestines, spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. Your target is stunned, requiring a hard (+2 to DC) Will save to recover from the stunning. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, they\'ll suffer a penalty of -4 to all tests. Removing the arrow requires three full actions and either a successful Medicine check or a challenging (+1 to DC) Reflex save. In addition, they must make a very hard (+5 to DC) Fortitude save or die from infection in 1d6 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing seals up the lacerations within half that time. Alternatively, a very hard (+5 to DC) Medicine check with expert proficiency can be attempted, reducing the difficulty level to merely hard (+2 to DC) if a successful Sremove spell is first performed.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks deep into your target\'s stomach just beneath the ribs on their left side and damages the spleen, causing internal bleeding. They is stunned until the end of their next turn and will then suffer a cumulative penalty of – 5% to attack rolls, attack rolls, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. In addition, penalties until the projectile is removed and subsequent risk of infection is as for #6 above. Fortunately, the bleeding will be brought to a halt by the tough membranous covering of the spleen, containing the damage before your target dies from loss of blood.","(TODO:) Your shot splits your target\'s breastbone but loses momentum before piercing their heart. The intense pain makes your opponent helpless until they can pass a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save, reducing it to stunning, requiring another test to recover from that. They can start rolling for those tests at the end of their next turn.","(TODO:) Your shot penetrates between your target\'s lower ribs, damaging a kidney. The massive bleeding causes a cumulative penalty of -2 to attack rolls, attack rolls, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless magically healed, they will die from loss of blood in another 1d6 turns. If they survives the arrow/bolt will need to be removed as for #6 above.","(TODO:) Your shot penetrates your target\'s chest, collapsing one lung. They must pass an immediate hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save to stay conscious, otherwise suffering a penalty of -5 to all tests, and will also suffer a 20% risk of dying each turn, until magical healing is provided. If they survives, the penalty will be reduced by 10% each week as the lung gradually expands again.","(TODO:) Your shot tears through your target\'s chest, damaging the aorta where it connects to the heart. The massive loss of blood causes a cumulative penalty of -4 to attack rolls, attack rolls, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, then also suffering a cumulative 20% chance of dying each turn as their heart futilely empties their system of blood.

If the GM judges that this result is unlikely, even with the extra strength brought on by a surge of adrenaline, such as if your opponent is an Ogre or otherwise severely outweighs you, your opponent nevertheless still is thrown badly off balance and ends up on the floor, knocked down and counting as stunned for 1d4 turns.","(TODO:) You slam either your fist or the heel of your foot into the upper part of your opponent\'s solar plexus, snapping the lower part of their breastbone. The fragment drives into their chest, lacerating the diaphragm muscles that they breathes with. They falls helplessly to their knees, gasping and helpless for 1d6 turns until they keels over unconscious. They\'ll have to pass a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or die in another 2d10 turns, otherwise suffering a permanent reduction of -15% to S and T due to reduced breathing capacity. If your opponent is wearing a breastplate they is instead hurled backwards, hitting their head as they lands, laying them out cold but otherwise very much alive and unhurt.","(TODO:) You grab you opponent and with irresistible force slam them down on their back across your knee, breaking their spine. They must pass an immediate very hard (+5 to DC) Fortitude save or die on the spot, otherwise becoming permanently paralysed from the waist down and counting as helpless from shock for the duration of the combat.

Make an opposed Athletics check, your opponent gaining a +20% bonus to their S if they is holding a shield or a twohanded weapon. If you beat them you have snatched it away and are now in possession of it. Weapons that are mostly blade, such as swords or knives, are much harder to grab, requiring a successful hard (+2 to DC) Reflex save first. If you fail, or if your opponent is holding nothing in that hand, the result is as per #1 above.","(TODO:) You slam an elbow, fist or booted foot into your opponent\'s biceps, bruising the muscle, causing a penalty of -2 to their attack rolls and S for any tests or blows using that arm for the duration of the combat.","(TODO:) You manage to grab and badly twist your opponent\'s wrist, making them drop whatever they is holding in that hand.

Your opponent counts as stunned until the end of their next turn and must pass a Will save each time they wants to perform any action with that hand for the duration of the battle. Setting the finger straight again and tying it to a small splint or a neighbouring finger is painful but easy, but your opponent will still suffer a penalty of -2 to any tasks, attacks or parries due to pain and swelling until the bone has started to heal properly in two weeks.","(TODO:) You hit your opponent\'s hand, fracturing a couple of the metacarpals, the bones between wrist and fingers, a classical “boxer\'s fracture” usually caused by punching something hard. The hand is useless until the bones have started healing properly in two weeks.","(TODO:) You slam your opponent in the junction between neck and shoulder with a vicious chop, breaking the collarbone. Your opponent is stunned until the end of their next turn and then suffers a penalty of -4 to any tests made with that arm until the fracture has healed in three weeks.","(TODO:) You smash your opponent with a mighty blow, dislocating the shoulder from its socket. Your opponent is stunned until they can pass a challenging (+1 to DC) Will save, getting one attempt at the beginning of each of their turns.

They must pass a challenging (+1 to DC) Will save or be stunned for 1d4 turns. The hand is useless until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless the wrist has been properly set with a successful Medicine check within the first week, they will then suffer a penalty of -2 to attack rollAthletics checks or tests requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand afterward due to improperly set bones. Magical healing will automatically do this, as well as speeding up the healing process, ignoring the month required.","(TODO:) You lock your opponent\'s arm in a strong grip and then either twist it forcefully or bring up a knee to slam into the elbow joint, snapping the elbow with a loud crack. Your opponent is stunned for 1d4 turns and the arm useless until the fracture has healed in four weeks.","(TODO:) You grab your opponent\'s arm and twist around, throwing them across your hip.

They must pass a hard (+2 to DC) Reflex save or break their neck as they lands, killing them. If they passes they is still knocked unconscious. If the GM judges that such a throw is completely unlikely, such as if they very considerably outweighs you, or has a very low centre of gravity (think Dwarf in plate!), or your legs are crippled, then you instead manage to get them so off balance that they is still hurled prone and knocked unconscious, perhaps tripping them up as they stumbles past you."],"Legs":["A glancing blow hits your opponent\'s shin, the pain causing a penalty of -1 to their attack rolls until the end of their next turn.","You strike your opponent on the inside of their thigh, barely missing their groin.

Your opponent is stunned until they can pass a challenging (+1 to DC) Will save, getting their first attempt at the beginning of their next turn, re-rolling each turn until they succeeds. The pain from the broken bones halves their movement and makes all Dodge Blow tests count as hard (+2 to DC) until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless properly set with a successful Medicine check during the first week, the bones will heal badly, causing a permanent penalty of –1 to movement and making all future Dodge Blow tests count as challenging (+1 to DC). Magical healing will correct this, as well as ignore the time required to heal the bones.","(TODO:) You break your opponent\'s ankle, making them prone. They is stunned for 1d4 turns and cannot use the leg until the fracture has healed in three weeks.

This is extremely painful and effectively locks the joint. Your opponent falls prone and is stunned for 1d6 turns, afterward being unable to use the leg and suffering a penalty of -4 to all tests until the kneecap is popped back into place. This requires a successful Medicine check, and probably a couple of strong helpers to hold the screaming patient down as the healer performs this very painful manoeuvre. (If your opponent is wearing Plate Leggings, this is an unlikely result and the hit instead counts as #8 above.) ","(TODO:) You slam a powerful blow into the side of your opponent\'s knee, bending the knee inwards in a most painful and unnatural manner, popping something inside the joint. Ligaments inside the knee have snapped, making the joint unstable. Your opponent is stunned for 1d4 turns and then suffers a penalty -2 to all tests for the duration of the combat, as well as suffering a permanent penalty of –2 to movement and counting all Dodge Blow tests as hard (+2 to DC) from now on.

They\'ll have to pass an regular Fortitude save or fall unconscious from the pain. If successful, they suffers a penalty of -5 to all tests for the duration of the battle, the penalty reduced by one third per week of rest. Regardless, the leg is useless and will probably never heal properly. movement is permanently reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as very hard (+5 to DC) from now on. Proper healing will require either two months in traction, lying in bed with the leg held up and stretched by weights, under supervision of someone with expert proficiency, or magical healing, the latter counting as a hard (+2 to DC) spell test due to damagremoveerves and small blood vessels supplying the joint.","(TODO:) You shatter your opponent\'s shinbone, fragments spearing through the skin. Your opponent falls prone, helpless and blind with pain for 1d6 turns, then suffering a penalty of -4 to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Such an open fracture is very serious, almost always resulting in gangrene and infection. They\'ll have to pass a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or suffer infection within 1d6 days, causing death in another 1d6 days unless amputation is performed. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will save their life but the leg will remain useless unless magically healed, which will require a hard (+2 to DC) spell test due to the mess of bone shards, damaged nerves and blood vessels inside the leg.

shot nicks your target’s ear, causing a –10% penalty to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot grazes your target’s cheek, slicing open a wound that bleeds far more freely than expected. He’ll lose one attack or free parry on his next turn as he clasps one hand to his face. ","Your shot grazes your target’s neck, causing him to flinch and suffer a penalty of –20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot slashes across your target’s ear, almost entirely severing the top third. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn. In addition the flopping of the detached portion will be very distracting, causing a penalty of –10% to his WS for d10/2 turns. After the battle and any usual Heal tests, an additional Hard (-20%) Heal test can be attempted for the purpose of successfully stitching the two parts of the ear back together. This second test does not restore your W characteristic any further. ","Your shot grazes your target’s scalp, causing blood to flow into his eyes, as per Cutting Damage to Head #4. ","Your shot tears a furrow along your target’s jaw, exposing white bone and teeth. He is stunned until he can pass either a WP or T test, starting to roll on the turn after his next. The scarring will be unattractive but will not reduce his Fel by any significant margin. ","Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, knocks out a couple of teeth, lacerates the tongue and exits through the opposite cheek. Your target will suffer a penalty of –20% to his WS until the arrow is removed, requiring a full action. If attempting it himself, your target must first pass a WP test. Failure simply means the arrow remains. After the arrow is removed, the target will spit blood and teeth but suffer only –10% to his WS for the duration of the battle due to pain and the blood trickling down his throat. The tongue and the holes in his cheeks will heal naturally although he’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to any Fel tests requiring speech until his W characteristic is fully restored. ","Your shot enters through your target’s neck, burying itself to the fletching. Surprisingly, there is very little blood, the arrow/bolt apparently having missed the major arteries or veins. Until the arrow/bolt is removed all the target’s tests count as Hard (-20%). Removal requires either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test. Failure means a major artery was nicked during the removal process and either magical healing or another Hard (-20%) Heal test will be required to save him from bleeding to death within d10 turns. ","Your shot enters your opponent’s cheek near the nose and drives on into the nasal cavity, crumpling the thin walls to the nearby sinus. Your target will be at –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to blood and bone fragments filling his mouth and nose. He is also stunned for d10 turns and must pass a WP test or gain one IP extra due to the horrifying experience of seeing an arrow sticking from his face. Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests. ","Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, shattering a couple of upper molars and lodging in the mandibular joint between the upper and lower jaw. Your target can no longer either open or close his mouth properly and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the arrow/bolt is removed, due to extreme pain and the blood filling his mouth. Removal will require a Challenging (-10%) Heal test or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test, taking three full actions. Failure means the arrow remains and a new test cannot be performed until the next day. ","Your shot punctures one of your target’s eyeballs, lodging in the bony orbit and causing a clear gelatinous substance to run down his face. The target is stunned until the end of the battle. No amount of mundane or magical healing can restore the eye and he suffers reduction of any BS or sightbased Perception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter. ","Your shot pierces your target’s forehead, penetrating the skull by about an inch or two and damaging one frontal lobe of the brain. The target is stunned for d10 turns. He must then pass a Hard (-20%) T test or fall unconscious. If he passes he will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the end of the battle and must then pass an additional Hard (-20%) T test or suffer a lethal infection, making him delirious and helpless within one day, killing him within d10/2 days. A Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection. Survival will reduce his Fel by –20% due to personality changes and he will also gain a random Insanity. ","Your shot enters through one eye, penetrating into the brain and knocking your target unconscious. Death ensues within d10/2 turns unless magical healing is provided, counting as a Very Hard (-30%) spell test. Survival will mean the head of the arrow/bolt remains inside his skull and he will suffer a penalty of –20% to WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel for the rest of his life due to brain damage. ","Your shot slams into your target, coming out through the back of his neck. There is a 25% chance the shot went in through the mouth, turning him into a gruesome sight indeed and severing the spinal cord on the way out, otherwise going in through the throat and severing a carotid artery in a gush of blood. Either way, the target falls to the ground and gurgles for d10/2 turns before dying inevitably. ","Your shot spits your target’s head like an apple, killing him instantly, although his body will continue to twitch a bit for d10/2 turns."],"Body":["Your shot grazes your target’s side, causing him to flinch and suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn.","Your shot slices along one rib, slicing the skin to the bone, causing a penalty of –20% to your target’s WS until the end of his next turn.","Your shot pierces your target’s flank just beneath the skin, the arrow/bolt sticking there and causing a penalty of – 20% to his WS until the end of his next turn, the penalty then reduced to –10% until the projectile is removed, requiring a full action (one half-action to break off the shaft, another half-action to withdraw the stump).","Your shot clips your target’s shoulder, knocking him to the ground.","Your shot lodges under a rib, causing your target intense pain every time he moves, making him suffer a –10% penalty to his WS until the arrow/bolt is removed. This takes two full actions and requires a successful Heal test or a Hard (-20%) Ag test. Failure means the shaft broke but the head of the arrow remains lodged in your target’s ribcage, now instead requiring a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test and six full actions to remove.","Your shot pierces your target’s side, penetrating the wall of muscle and entering his abdominal cavity but missing any internal organs. Your target suffers a –20% penalty to his WS until the arrow/bolt is removed, requiring two full actions and a successful Heal test or a Challenging (-10%) Ag test. Failure means that the projectile was successfully withdrawn but additional damage was caused, delaying healing, resulting in the target regaining one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W. In addition to delayed healing, the target must pass a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer an infection within one day, making him delirious and helpless for d10 days. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection.","Your shot sinks into your target’s shoulder (roll d10: 1-5 right, 6-10 left) near the neck, barely missing the top of the lung. Due to the discomfort of having an arrow/bolt sticking out of his body, your target suffers a penalty of – 20% to his WS when using that arm, until the projectile is removed. Unfortunately, the point is lodged deep underneath the collarbone, requiring six full turns and either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test to avoid puncturing the lung. If this happens, the target suffers a cumulative –5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reach zero and expiring within another 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided.","Your shot sinks into the target’s belly, felling him to the ground. The projectile has lacerated the intestines, spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. Your target is stunned, requiring a Hard (-20%) WP test to recover from the stunning. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, he’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to all tests. Removing the arrow requires three full actions and either a successful Heal test or a Challenging (-10%) Ag test. In addition, he must make a Very Hard (-30%) T test or die from infection in d10 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing seals up the lacerations within half that time. Alternatively, a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent can be attempted, reducing the difficulty level to merely Hard (-20%) if a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is first performed.","Your shot sinks deep into your target’s stomach just beneath the ribs on his left side and damages the spleen, causing internal bleeding. He is stunned until the end of his next turn and will then suffer a cumulative penalty of – 5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. In addition, penalties until the projectile is removed and subsequent risk of infection is as for #6 above. Fortunately, the bleeding will be brought to a halt by the tough membranous covering of the spleen, containing the damage before your target dies from loss of blood.","Your shot splits your target’s breastbone but loses momentum before piercing his heart. The intense pain makes your opponent helpless until he can pass a Hard (-20%) T test, reducing it to stunning, requiring another test to recover from that. He can start rolling for those tests at the end of his next turn.","Your shot penetrates between your target’s lower ribs, damaging a kidney. The massive bleeding causes a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless magically healed, he will die from loss of blood in another d10 turns. If he survives the arrow/bolt will need to be removed as for #6 above.","Your shot penetrates your target’s chest, collapsing one lung. He must pass an immediate Hard (-20%) T test to stay conscious, otherwise suffering a penalty of –30% to all tests, and will also suffer a 20% risk of dying each turn, until magical healing is provided. If he survives, the penalty will be reduced by 10% each week as the lung gradually expands again.","Your shot tears through your target’s chest, damaging the aorta where it connects to the heart. The massive loss of blood causes a cumulative penalty of –20% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, then also suffering a cumulative 20% chance of dying each turn as his heart futilely empties his system of blood. Only a Very Hard magical healing spell test can save his life.","Your shot tears out through your target’s back, lacerating his liver, severing his abdominal aorta, damaging the spinal cord and felling him helpless to the ground, coughing up blood and bilious fluid. Death is inevitable in d10/2 turns.","Your shot transfixes your target’s heart, killing him instantly"],"Arms":["Your shot grazes your target’s hand, forcing him to pass a WP test or drop anything he is holding in that hand. ","Your shot nicks the wrist of your target, causing a small but vicious wound. Due to the pain, he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot glances off your target’s elbow, sending an electric shock of pain down his arm, making him drop anything he is holding in that hand. The arm is numb and useless for d10/2 turns. ","Your shot slices your target’s biceps, exposing red, glistening muscle tissue. He suffers a penalty of –20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot penetrates the large muscle connecting your target’s shoulder to the upper arm, the arrow/bolt remaining in the wound with the point sticking out the other side. He must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. He also loses use of the arm until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which requires a full action (half an action to break off the head, another to pull the shaft out) either by himself or someone else, plus a successful Challenging (-10%) WP test if he does it himself, gritting his teeth against the pain. ","Your shot slices the back of your target’s hand, severing tendons and nicking the metacarpal bones between the wrist and fingers. He can still flex his fingers, so he doesn’t drop his weapon, but the distracting sight of twitching tendons and white bone causes a penalty of – 20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. Unless magically healed he’ll suffer a permanent –10% penalty to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand due to decreased manual dexterity from not being able to open his hand properly. ","Your shot transfixes your target’s hand, passing between the metacarpal bones between wrist and fingers, and nailing it to any shield he might be holding in that hand. Until the arrow is removed, as per #5 above, the hand is useless. He also counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and, unless magically healed, will suffer a permanent –5% penalty to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand, due to nerve damage to his middle finger.","Your shot transfixes your target’s wrist, resulting in penalties as for #7 above, except that you must pass a WP test to recover from the stunning and the penalty will be – 20% due to the much greater damage to nerves and tendons. ","Your shot penetrates your target’s forearm, the point lodging in one of the long bones of the forearm. Your target is stunned for d10/2 turns. The arm is useless until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which is very difficult due to the head being firmly embedded in the bone, requiring three full actions either by you or someone else, plus a successful Hard (-20%) WP test if you do it yourself. ","Your shot lodges in your target’s elbow, severing the head of one of the long bones of the forearm and jamming the joint at a 90-degree angle. Your target is stunned by blinding pain for d10/2 turns and the arm is useless until his W characteristic has been fully recovered. Also the head of the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn. This requires either a successful Heal test or, if lacking that skill, a Hard (-20%) Ag test, by someone else. Failure means the head was successfully withdrawn but additional damage means healing is delayed, the target recovering one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W. ","Your shot lacerates the target’s biceps muscle, also severing the large artery in the arm. Due to the spurting arterial spray, he will suffer a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, losing consciousness when any of those characteristics reaches zero. When he wakes up the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn as per #5 above. ","Your shot pierces the meaty part of your target’s shoulder near the neck, damaging the brachial plexus, the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm. He must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. Unless magically healed within one day, which will count as a Hard (-20%) spell test, the paralysis will be permanent, rendering the arm limp and useless. Also, the arrow/bolt will have to be removed as per #10 above. ","Your shot shatters your target’s shoulder-blade and severs the large artery branching off from the aorta to the arm and neck, causing massive internal bleeding. An immediate Hard (-20%) T test is required to avoid falling unconscious. He also suffers a cumulative 10% risk of dying from loss of blood each turn, unless magically healed. If he survives, the arrow/bolt will have to be removed as per #10 above. ","Your shot enters your target’s shoulder at an angle and exits through his neck in a spray of blood.

The target is stunned until the end of his next turn, then suffers a –2 penalty to his M as well as counting all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) until the end of the battle, as his toes won’t obey him properly, making footing awkward. Unless magical or surgical healing is provided within d10/2 days, M will be permanently reduced by –1. ","Your shot transfixes the target’s foot, pinning it to the ground. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, M is reduced to zero, all WS tests count as Challenging (–10%) and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%). Removal requires two full turns and use of both hands. ","Your shot transfixes your target’s calf, fracturing the outer of the two bones of the lower leg. Until the end of the battle all tests are counted as Hard (-20%) due to the blinding pain. In addition, until the target’s W characteristic is fully restored, M is reduced by –2 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%). Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests. ","Your shot slams through your target’s knee, the point tearing out the back of the joint. Until the projectile has been removed from the jammed knee, M is reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%). Removing the arrow/bolt takes three full actions. Fragments of bone left inside the joint causes the knee to stiffen up and lock itself at inopportune moments, causing  a permanent –1 penalty to M and making all Dodge Blow tests count as Challenging (-10%). ","Your shot shatters your target’s shinbone, knocking him to the ground writhing in pain. He counts as helpless for d10/2 turns and is unable to support himself on that leg until the fracture has healed in six weeks. Hopping on one leg counts as having a Move of 1 and all WS and Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%). One crutch reduces the difficulty of the tests to Hard (-20%) but requires the use of one hand. Two crutches enables you to limp along at a Move of 2 but requires both hands and Dodge Blow tests still count as Hard (-20%). ","Your shot shatters your target’s kneecap, knocking him to the ground.

","Your blow crashes into your opponent’s skull, stunning him until the end of his next turn. On his next turn after that he must pass a Hard (-20%) T test to recover, rerolling each turn until he succeeds. The blow has fractured his skull, causing a splinter of bone to press into his brain and starting a slow bleeding between the brain and the skull that will keep expanding, eventually killing him unless pressure is relieved. He’ll suffer a cumulative penalty of –5% to his WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel every two hours, falling into a coma when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying within another d10/2 days. The only effective cure is a procedure called trepanation, which involves removing a piece of the skull by drilling or boring into it, thus relieving the pressure and allowing access to remove the splinter. This requires at least one hour and a Challenging (-10%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent. If successful, a metal plate of some kind, usually a silver coin that has been hammered flat and polished, is used to cover the hole, nailed directly to the surrounding bone and then covered with a flap of the scalp. If already in a coma, your opponent will then wake up in another d10/2 days, otherwise regaining his lost characteristics at a rate of 5% per day. Failure will still relieve the pressure but causes brain damage, reducing WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel by –10% permanently.

He gasps for breath, suffering a cumulative penalty of –10% to his WS, BS, Ag and S each turn until he makes a Challenging (-10%) T test to immediately regain the lost characteristics points, rolling at the start of each turn. If any of the characteristics reaches zero he falls unconscious from lack of air. If not making his roll within another TB turns he dies from lack of air. ","Your weapon crushed the bony orbit surrounding your opponent’s eyeball, causing a blow-out fracture, pushing  bone splinters into the sinus and trapping some of the muscles controlling eye movement. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn. On his next turn after that he must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test to recover, rerolling each turn until he succeeds.

Removal requires two full turns, a sharp knife and a successful Easy (+20%) Heal test. ","Your bullet makes a hole through your target’s hand, smashing some of the bones between the wrist and the fingers and severing the tendons to one digit, either the middle or ring finger as the GM deems fit.

Your target is stunned until the end of his next turn. If the thumb is lost, grip will be very poor, reducing WS, Ag and S by a penalty of –20% for any tests or blows made with that hand. Loss of a pinkie is mostly cosmetic in effect and the target can count himself lucky. Loss of any other finger will result in penalties as for #6 above. ","Your bullet shatters your target’s wrist, smashing the many small wrist-bones and severely damaging nerves and tendons. Anything held in that hand is dropped. Your target counts as stunned and must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping anything held in the opposite hand to grab his injury. At the end of his next turn he must pass a WP test to recover from the stunning, rolling again next turn if he fails. The hand is useless until the target’s W characteristic is fully restored. He must then pass a Hard (-20%) T test. Failure means the hand remains next to useless, stiff and with hardly any function left in the fingers. If successful, he’ll suffer a permanent penalty of – 20% to WS, Ag and S tests (as well as any tests requiring fine manipulation) made with that hand due to stiffness and reduced manual dexterity. Magical healing will heal the injury completely if provided with d10/2 days. ","Your bullet lodges in the target’s elbow, jamming the joint. Your target is stunned by blinding pain for d10/2 turns and the arm is useless until the bullet is removed. This requires a successful Heal test with the Surgery talent.

In addition, he must pass a second test or the infection will spread, killing him within another d10 days unless amputation is performed. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will heal the infection but not remove the bullet or restore function in the arm. ","Your bullet smashes your target’s collarbone. He is stunned for d10 turns and suffers a penalty of –30% to all tests performed with that arm, including for calculating SB, until his W characteristic is fully recovered. ","Your bullet shatters the bone of your target’s upper arm. The target is stunned by blinding pain for d10 turns and the arm is useless.

Also, the lodged bullet will permanently reduce his W by –1. ","Your bullet shatters your target’s shoulder-blade and severs the large artery branching off from the aorta to the arm. The victim of your lethal accuracy will suffer a 30% risk of dying from loss of blood each turn, unless magically healed which will require a Hard (-20%) spell test.

Also, the lodged bullet will permanently reduce his W by –1 if he survives. ","Your bullet almost tears your target’s arm off at the shoulder, severing major blood vessels. He immediately falls unconscious and will inevitably die in a spreading pool of blood within d10/2 turns.

His M is reduced by –2 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) until the muscles have healed when your target’s W characteristic is fully restored. Unfortunately, the bullet will have carried a small piece of wadding or a piece of the target’s pants into the wound, causing an infection that will slow the healing process, meaning he’ll recover one less W the next time he should have restored some of his W characteristic. The bullet will then be encapsulated by fibrous tissue and not cause any further problems. ","Your bullet goes cleanly through your target’s calf, fracturing the outer of the two bones in the lower leg and tearing out a sizeable chunk of flesh. Your target is stunned until the end of his next turn. His M is reduced by –2 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) until the muscles and bone have healed when your target’s W characteristic is fully restored. In addition, the huge gaping wound will cause a cumulative penalty of –5% to the target’s WS, BS, Ag and S each turn. He’ll fall unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, although the spurting blood vessels will then contract and prevent him from bleeding out entirely. ","Your bullet shatters your target’s kneecap, dropping him to the ground in a howling heap, helpless with pain for d10 turns. Unless magical healing is provided, M is permanently halved and all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) from now on, due to extensive damage to the joint. ","Your bullet shatters your target’s shinbone, knocking him to the ground writhing in pain. He counts as helpless for d10/2 turns and is unable to support himself on that leg until the fracture has healed in six weeks. Hopping on one leg counts as having a Move of 1 and all WS and Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%). One crutch reduces the difficulty of the tests to Hard (-20%) but requires the use of one hand. Two crutches enables you to limp along at a Move of 2 but requires both hands and Dodge Blow tests still count as Hard (-20%). ","Your bullet smashes into your target’s hip, lodging in the smashed joint. The hipbone is badly fractured and the pelvis chipped, dropping the target to the ground, helpless with pain for d10/2 turns. The leg is useless until the fracture has healed in six weeks. If the leg was set with a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent, limited mobility is returned although M is reduced by –2 and all Dodge Blow tests will count as Challenging (-10%). Otherwise the hip will heal in a bad position, making the joint very stiff and painful, reducing M to 1 and making all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%). ","Your bullet shatters your target’s thighbone into several fragments, knocking him to the ground, clasping his leg in agony, counting as helpless for d10 turns, then suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests for the duration of the battle due to the agonizing pain. Such an injury requires magical healing within d10 days or it will develop gangrene and need amputation.

Bleeding excessively, the target falls to the ground, suffering a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. He’ll then die from loss of blood in another d10/2 turns unless magical healing is provided.

Death is mercifully quick, your opponent dying within two turns from loss of blood and sheer shock at your ferocious strength."]},"Cutting":{"Head":["The flat of your blade clips your opponent’s head.

","Your weapon glances off your opponent’s temple, causing momentary disorientation. He suffers a penalty of –20% on his WS until the end of his next turn. ","You slash your opponent across the forehead. The flow of blood into his eyes will cause a penalty of –20% to his WS until he spends a half action to wipe it away. Each turn after that there is a 30% risk more blood will flow down, repeating the modifier, possibly occurring again and again until he can take two whole turns to bandage the wound. ","The flat of your weapon lands a solid blow to the side of your opponent’s head, stunning him. At the start of each of his subsequent turns after the next he must take a T test to recover from it, after which he can fight normally. ","You nick a major vein in your opponent’s neck, causing heavy bleeding. Until he has two full turns of bandaging and a successful Heal test performed on him, he must, after a number of turns equal to his TB characteristic, start passing a Routine (+10%) T test each turn, falling unconscious from loss of blood if he fails. ","You slice off a large part of one of your opponent’s ears, the pain causing a penalty of –20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. Unless hiding his injury he will also suffer a penalty of –5% to his Fel in any situation where good looks are important. ","Your weapon slices off your opponent’s nose as he bends backward in an attempt to dodge your blow. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and will suffer a permanent –10% modifier to his Fel. However, he will have a +10% bonus modifier to Intimidation tests. A prosthetic nose will halve both modifiers. ","You cut deep into your opponent’s scalp, chipping the skull. He must make an immediate T test or fall unconscious from the blow. If he succeeds he counts as stunned his next two turns and must then make another T test to recover or remain stunned. ","Your weapon crashes into the side of your opponent’s head, stunning him until the end of his next turn, severing one ear and ruining his hearing on that side. The unsightly scar across that side of his face reduces his Fel by –10% (but Critical Hits – Cutting Damage adds +10% to any Intimidation tests) and the hearing loss causes a –15% penalty to all hearing-related Perception tests. ","You slice your opponent across the eyes. There is a 50% risk for each eye that it is destroyed. If neither eye is destroyed you merely nicked his eyelids and the bridge of his nose, causing severe pain and blood in the eyes, but your opponent still counts as helpless until he makes a successful Challenging (-10%) T test, starting his attempts on his next turn, and even after succeeding he suffers –20% to his WS, BS and Ag until he has been properly bandaged after the battle. He then needs to keep the bandages on, effectively blinding him, until he has recovered at least one W. If either eye is destroyed your opponent counts as helpless and partly blinded as above but also must reduce any BS or sight-based Perception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter. If both eyes are destroyed your opponent is totally blind and helpless. ","Your weapon opens a large gash from the forehead to the jaw, cutting across and destroying one eye. He suffers penalties as for the loss of one eye as per #11 above but also has his Fel reduced by –20% due to the horribly disfiguring scar, although he gains a +10% bonus to any Intimidation tests. ","Your weapon slices through your opponent’s lower jaw, causing the loss of several teeth as well as a portion of the tongue. Loss of blood is significant. Your opponent must make an immediate Hard (-20%) T test or fall unconscious. If he fails he must make another unmodified T test to avoid choking to death on his own blood, unless someone else realizes his predicament with a successful Int or Heal test and rolls him over onto his side to let the blood and gore drain out of his mouth. If conscious he will be stunned for one turn and then suffers a penalty of –20% to WS and BS due to the pain for the duration of the battle. Scarring will cause penalties as per #12 above. Also he will suffer an additional penalty of –10% to any tests requiring him to be clearly heard due to speech difficulties from the missing piece of tongue. ","Your weapon describes an arc through your opponent’s temple, taking off a large chunk of his skull and brain, causing you to be showered by a spray of blood, bone chips and brain matter. No healing in the world will prevent your opponent from expiring in d10/2 turns. ","Your weapon cleanly severs your opponent’s head, causing it to fly d10-5 yards in a random direction as twin jets of blood shoot up from the trunk of his neck, the mouth of the head working in a futile attempt to scream as it arcs through the air before death occurs a fraction of a turn later. If the result is zero yards or less, you merely slashed through his throat, giving him a wide new smile, and his head remains attached to his neck, although he’ll die almost as quickly.

As your opponent stumbles backward he will not be able to perform any attack action on his next turn.

","A long cut along a rib leaves white bone gleaming through the wound. The shock and pain earns your opponent a penalty of –10% to all actions until the end of his next turn. ","Your weapon cuts into the soft tissues over your opponent’s collarbone, chipping the bone. He must make a Very Hard (-30%) WP test or drop his weapon. ","Your weapon splits one of your opponent’s ribs. He must make a Hard (-20%) T test or count as stunned until the end of his next turn as he gasps for breath. For the rest of this battle he will suffer a penalty of –5% to any parries due to the pain from the damaged chest muscles connecting to his shoulder and upper arm. ","Your weapon slices across your opponent’s chest, splitting open leather or mail links and dislodging any shoulder plates, reducing the AP of his body armour by 1. If he is not wearing any armour the result will be as for #4 above. ","You carve deeply into your opponent’s side, lodging your weapon in the bony portion of his hip. He falls to the ground, writhing in pain, causing him to count as helpless until the end of his next turn. On your next turn you must make an Easy (+20%) S test to dislodge your weapon, whereupon you can take a full action as normal. Until you succeed you will be unable to use the weapon and your opponent will continue to be counted as stunned due to the excruciating pain of your wrenching and twisting of your weapon in his wound. Letting go of your weapon counts as having dislodged it. Your opponent can try to tear himself free by passCritical Hits – Cutting Damage ing both an Average WP test and an Easy (+20%) S test, an exception to the rule of not being able to perform any actions when stunned, although he’ll still count as helpless on that turn, regardless of whether or not he succeeds. ","Your weapon drives into the right side of your opponent’s abdomen, just underneath the ribs, penetrating the wall of flesh and muscle into his abdominal cavity and nicking the gallbladder. Your opponent must make a Hard (-20%) T test or be stunned for d10/2 turns. In addition, he must make a Very Hard (-30%) T test or die from infection in d10 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing, the Shallyan Cure Disease spell or a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent is made within half that time. The latter involves a very risky surgical procedure, digging deep into the abdomen, stitching up the holes and cleaning out any gall or other foul substances visible. ","Your weapon slices into your opponent’s groin, causing dramatic bleeding and stunning him for d10 turns (d10/2 if female). He’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to the pain. In addition there is a 50% risk he will be rendered permanently sterile from the injury (10% if female). ","Your weapon slices into your opponent’s belly and groin, puncturing the bladder. With a faint odour of ammonia, urine spills from the wound and onto your blade. Your opponent must make a Challenging (-10%) WP test or gain one extra IP as he realizes what has happened. He will suffer a penalty of –20% to all actions for the rest of the battle. Fortunately, urine is more or less sterile, meaning he will only have to make a Challenging (-10%) T test to avoid contracting a lethal infection as for #7 above. If he survives he must make a Challenging (-10%) T test or be prone to leakage and constantly reek of urine, permanently reducing his Fel by –10%. ","Your weapon cuts through the lower left ribs and drives deep into the abdominal cavity, lacerating the spleen. The heavy internal bleeding resulting from this will cause a cumulative loss of –5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn. When any of those characteristics reaches zero your opponent falls unconscious and will die within d10/2 hours unless successful magical healing or a successful surgery is performed. In the latter case the procedure is as for Blunt Damage to Body #6 except that time is quickly running out, leaving less time for getting your opponent to a surgeon. ","Your weapon deeply penetrates your opponent’s belly, badly lacerating both the small and large intestine, spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. He will have to make an immediate Challenging (-10%) T test or fall unconscious. If successful he’ll still be at –20% to all tests due to pain and shock for the duration of the combat. Such a wound inevitably causes a severe infection and hardly any amount of mundane healing in the Old World can repair such damage, the victim usually dying within d10/2 days. Should an attempt at Heal with the Surgery Talent be made it will count as Very Hard (-30%) and even if the surgeon is successful your opponent must still pass a Very Hard (-30%) T test or succumb to infection anyway. Any successful magical healing attempt will take care of the infection as well but will also be counted as Very Hard (-30%) unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell has first been performed, in which case it merely counts as Challenging (-10%). ","Your weapon opens your opponent’s abdomen, spilling his entrails about his feet. Death will occur within d10 turns unless magical healing as per #11 is obtained. Until that time your opponent can do nothing except futilely try to stuff the spilt entrails back into his ruined abdomen. Anyone surviving such a horrifying experience will gain d10/2 IP. ","Your weapon slices deep into your opponent, splitting several ribs before severing the spinal cord and lodging in a vertebra. As you yank loose your weapon he falls down and must make an immediate Hard (-20%) T test or die on the spot. If successful he will be helpless for the duration of the battle and will then be a cripple for the rest of his life, paralysed from the waist down. No amount of mundane or magical healing, except possibly the direct personal intervention of Shallya herself, could repair such an injury.

","Your weapon bites into the target’s biceps muscle. Until he has healed at least one W, any attacks or parries made with that arm will suffer a penalty of –20% to WS, BS and S. ","Your weapon drives into the large deltoid muscle of your opponent’s shoulder, sending a shock down the entire arm, causing whatever is held in that hand to be dropped. For the rest of the combat he suffers a penalty of –10% to his WS, due to the pain. ","Your weapon opens up your opponent’s forearm, slicing open the skin to expose red, twitching, glistening layers of muscle. Anything held in that hand is dropped and the opponent must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or count as stunned until the end of his next turn, staring at the hideous sight. If he fails he’ll drop anything held in the other hand, grasping at the wound in an attempt to close it. He may attempt another test on each subsequent turn to recover from this, now at his unmodified WP. ","Your weapon slices into your opponent’s forearm, rebounding from the bone. Anything held in that hand is dropped and the hand is useless until his injury level is changed back to Lightly Wounded. ","Your weapon slices into your opponent’s forearm, damaging muscles and tendons, lodging in the bone for a fraction of a second before being wrenched loose. Your opponent is stunned until the end of his next turn and the hand is useless until his W characteristic is fully restored. In addition, he’ll suffer a permanent penalty of –10% to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that arm, due to difficulties opening the fingers properly. ","Your weapon severs your opponent’s biceps muscle from its tendonous attachments to the bones in the forearm. The entire arm is useless until his W characteristic is fully restored. However, magical healing or a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent is needed to restore full function; otherwise any use of that arm will suffer a –20% penalty, including for WS, BS and S tests, due to the severed muscle and tendon ends not knitting together properly, making it difficult to flex the arm. ","Your weapon cleanly slices a large chunk of flesh from the meaty part of the upper arm and shoulder. Anything held in the hand is dropped, your opponent cannot use that arm and suffers a penalty of –20% to his WS for the duration of the combat due to pain and bleeding. He must also make an immediate Hard (-20%) T test or fall to the ground from the intense pain. ","Your weapon severs d10/2 fingers from your opponent’s hand. A result of 5 means the whole hand has been lopped off. He must make an immediate Hard (-20%) WP test or count as stunned until the end of his next turn. If more than two fingers are lost anything in that hand is dropped as well and it can no longer be used to hold any weapons. Any tasks requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand in the future suffers a penalty of –5% to any such test, per finger lost, with no task at all possible if the whole hand has been lost. If the whole hand has been severed your opponent will suffer a penalty of –10% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to shock and bleeding. ","Your opponent’s arm is severed at the elbow. Blood pumps out in bright spurts and he suffers a 20% chance of fainting from loss of blood each turn until a successful Heal test has staunched the bleeding, requiring two full turns of bandaging or a good burning, cauterising the wound. If left untended and unconscious he will bleed to death, suffering a 10% chance of dying each turn once unconscious.

If he survives, he’ll have his Fel reduced permanently by –20%, due to massive scarring such as large fibrous masses covering the cheek, one eye unable to close properly, missing lips, etc. Consult any episode of “Jonah Hex” for inspiration, dear GM! ","A piece of the target’s skull flips away, carved out by a piece of shrapnel, leaving the brain visible through the hole. Your target must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or be knocked unconscious. After the battle he must make a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer a lethal infection, killing him in d10/2 days unless saved by a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell. Should he survive, the skin will grow back over the hole but he will have a funny depression with a soft and sort of squishy centre on his head for the rest of his life. If he can find a willing surgeon he might have a metal plate put there later. ","Shrapnel tears into your target’s throat, damaging the windpipe and nicking a carotid artery. The target falls to the ground, gurgling and spitting blood, hands clasped to his throat. He counts as helpless and will die in 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided. If he survives, his voice will be distorted, weak and hoarse for the rest of his life, reducing his Fel by –10% in any situation where clear speech is important.

","A large piece of shrapnel carries away the top of your target’s head. He is dead almost before hitting the ground, and most definitely when he does, as most of his brain sloshes out of his brainpan.

","A big piece of metal clips your target’s shoulder, knocking him to the ground but otherwise leaving him unharmed. ","A chunk of shrapnel slams into your target’s chest and breaks a rib. He must make a Hard (-20%) T test or count as stunned until the end of his next turn as he gasps for breath. For the rest of this battle he will suffer a penalty of –5% to any parries due to the pain from the damaged chest muscles connecting to his shoulder and upper arm. ","A small fragment or pellet pierces your target’s right side just below the ribs, nicking the liver and causing internal bleeding. He must pass a Hard (-20%) T test or be stunned for d10/2 turns. In addition, after the battle, he’ll develop a tenderness of the abdomen, which soon becomes rigidly hard and painfully tender as your target develops peritonitis, a serious inflammation of the membranes covering the inside of the abdomen, forcing him to stay bedridden and helpless with pain for d10 days, at the end having to pass a T test or die from infection as bacteria festers in the clotted blood in his abdomen. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will save him from the infection. ","A jagged fragment sinks deep into your target’s shoulder beneath the collarbone, knocking him to the ground, stunning him until the end of his next turn and causing a penalty of –20% to his WS for another d10/2 turns. Unless the fragment is removed or a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is provided he’ll develop an infection due to pieces of his own clothing dragged deeply into the wound and festering inside the shoulder, making him delirious and helpless after d10/2 days, bringing death within another d10 days. Unfortunately, the fragment is well lodged deep underneath the collarbone near the top of the lung, so removal requires a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent. Failure will mean the fragment remains until a new test can be attempted the next day, but due to Critical Hits - Explosion & Shrapnel Damage further contamination of the wound, each failure reduces the time until death from infection by one day. ","Shrapnel slice into your target’s groin, stunning him for d10 turns (d10/2 if female). Afterward, the pain will cause a penalty of –10% to all tests for the remainder of the battle. In addition there is a 50% chance he will be rendered permanently sterile from the injury (10% if female). ","Pellets and pieces of shrapnel tear through your target’s belly, damaging the small intestine and spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. He crumples to his knees, hands pressed against his wound, helpless for d10 turns, subsequently suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests due to the awful pain. In addition, he must make a Very Hard (-30%) T test or die from infection in d10 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing, the Shallyan Cure Disease spell or a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent is made within half that time. The latter involves a very risky surgical procedure, digging deep into the abdomen, stitching up the holes and cleaning out any foul substances visible. ","Shrapnel punctures your target’s lung, making it rapidly collapse, causing a cumulative penalty of –5% to his WS, BS, Ag and S each turn. He’ll fall unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying within another 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided. ","A blast of shrapnel tears large chunks of flesh from your target’s chest, exposing ribs and muscle tissue. He’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to all tests due to pain and breathing difficulties until the injury has healed in four weeks. In addition, afterward he’ll have a permanent reduction of – 15% to his S due to major injury to the chest muscles connecting to his shoulders and upper arms. ","A blast of shrapnel rips into your target’s flank, tearing away muscle and flesh, some of the fragments piercing one kidney. He is stunned for d10 turns, staring at the huge hole in his body, then faints dead away. Internal and external bleeding will empty the poor guy out within 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided, counting as a Hard (-20%) spell test. ","Multiple pieces of shrapnel rips into your opponent’s chest, several of them penetrating into both lungs. The results will be as for #10 above, only with a penalty of – 15% each turn, and death will occur after d10 turns. ","A blast of shrapnel rips into your target’s abdomen, practically disembowelling him and spilling red ruin at his feet. He is helpless to do anything but vainly try to gather up his spilled intestines and stuff then back into his ruined belly, before slumping over and dying within d10 turns. ","A burst of shrapnel blasts open your target’s ribcage, ripping his heart and lungs to pieces, killing him instantly in an explosion of gore. "],"Arms":["A jagged piece of shrapnel grazes your target\'s hand, forcing him to pass a Challenging (-10%) WS test or drop anything held in that hand.

","A large shard of shrapnel lodges in the flesh of your target\'s forearm, causing him to miss one attack or free parry on his next turn as he waves his arm frantically to dislodge the hot piece of metal ","A piece of shrapnel nicks your target\'s wrist, cutting to the bone. No tendons or large blood vessels are damaged but your target drops whatever he is holding in that hand and suffers a penalty of -20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Shards of hot metal slash into your target\'s biceps muscle, tearing the flesh. He suffers a penalty of -20% to WS and -2 to SB for any attacks or parries made with that arm for the duration of the battle. Until the pieces of shrapnel are removed from the arm with a successful Heal test a penalty of -10% and -1, respectively, will remain. ","Shrapnel tears away d10/2 fingers. Effects are as for Cutting Damage to Arm #10, except that only fingers are lost regardless of the result, never the entire hand. ","Shrapnel deeply embeds itself into your target\'s upper arm, one large fragment lodging in the shoulder muscle next to the bone near the shoulder joint. Until removed it will cause a penalty of -30% to WS and -2 to SB for any attacks or parries made with that arm. Removal will require a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent. A Heal test without that Talent will count as Hard (-20%). Failure will leave the fragment in the arm, which will eventually heal after d10/2 weeks, embedding the fragment in fibrous tissue, but due to the resulting stiffness a penalty of -15% and -1, respectively, will remain. ","A large fragment rips through the inside of your target\'s elbow, severing blood vessels and damaging tendons. The target is stunned until the end of his next round and must then pass a Hard (-20%) WP test or drop everything to clap his other hand around the spurting wound. If he fails he may attempt further tests on subsequent turns to let go. Otherwise he\'ll clench his arm tightly to close the wound and continue to fight, unable to use that arm and suffering a penalty of -10% to his WS due to being unbalanced by the clenched arm held to his side. The arm will need to be tightly bandaged, requiring three full turns, to stop the bleeding. The arm will be useless until his W characteristic is fully recovered. Some stiffness will remain, causing a penalty of –10% to any WS tests made with that arm, unless magically healed. Alternatively, the magical healing can be replaced with a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent, halving the penalty. ","Fragments smash into your target\'s shoulder, fracturing the collarbone and tearing up some chest muscles. Your target will be stunned for d10/2 turns and suffer a penalty of -20% to both WS and S for any tests or blows made with that arm until the fracture has healed in d10/2 weeks. ","A large piece of shrapnel severs the top end of your target\'s biceps from the shoulder, leaving the muscle flopping like a big firm lump inside the skin of the arm near his elbow. Unless the muscle is successfully stitched back together within d10 days, requiring either magical healing or a successful Challenging (-10%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent plus four weeks of rest, he’ll suffer a permanent penalty of –20% to WS and S for any tasks performed with that arm in the future due to not being able to flex the arm well. ","Shrapnel rips through your target\'s upper arm, nicking a large artery. The spurts of blood cause a cumulative penalty of -5% to your target\'s WS, BS, Ag and S each turn until it has been tightly bandaged, requiring two full turns. A successful Hard (-20%) Ag test is also required if he does it himself, using one hand and his teeth. Otherwise he\'ll fall unconscious from loss of blood when any of those characteristics reaches zero. The wound will clot before he expires, however. ","A blast of fragments rips the flesh from your target\'s forearm and fractures one of the long bones, stunning him for d10 turns with pain and shock at such a ghastly sight. Only a Very Hard (-30%) magical healing spell test will save the arm, otherwise requiring amputation. ","A piece of shrapnel tears through the shoulder, ricocheting from bone into the chest and lacerating the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm. The arm will be permanently paralysed and useless. Your target will have to pass an immediate Hard (-20%) T test or fall unconscious from shock. ","A large chunk of shrapnel smashes through the collarbone and upper ribs, bouncing against the back of the shoulderblade before severing the large artery branching off from the aorta to the arm. A pumping spray of blood rises up from the wound in your target\'s shoulder near the neck, sending him into unconsciousness to die inevitably in a spreading pool of blood within d10/2 turns.

He’ll suffer a penalty of –2 to his M and –20% to all Dodge Blow tests until it is removed, either by magical healing or a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent. If the latter is used, the target must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or suffer an infection that will force amputation unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is performed. If the infection goes untreated and the leg remains attached, gangrene and sepsis will occur within d10/2 days, causing death within another TB days.

","A blast of shrapnel tears away chunks of flesh from your target’s calf, causing gaping wounds and fracturing the fibula, the outer of the two long bones in the lower leg, forcing him to pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test or fall to the ground. Your target’s M will be reduced to 1 as he hobbles along, counting any Dodge Blow tests as Very Hard (-30%) until the end of the battle. A combination of infection, severed blood vessels and just plain, massive loss of tissue means the leg will never heal properly, giving a permanent penalty of –2 to M and –20% to any Dodge Blow tests. ","Shrapnel shreds your target’s knee, utterly destroying the kneecap and penetrating into the joint, shredding bone and ligaments as it goes along. He falls to the ground, screaming and stunned for d10 turns. Unless magical healing is provided within d10 days, the leg will have to be amputated. Otherwise it’ll still be stiff and unbending, causing permanent penalties as per #8 above. ","A large piece of shrapnel pierces your target’s thigh, tearing out of the back of the leg in a spray of blood, leaving a huge flap of muscle gruesomely flapping. The blast knocks him to the ground, unable to get up. Loss of blood will cause a cumulative –5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, the target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless the leg is tightly bandaged, requiring someone else’s help and three full turns, death will occur within another 2d10 turns. ","Fragments tear into the hip joint, causing nerve damage that leaves the whole leg limp and useless, totally paralysed. Your target falls to the ground, stunned for d10 turns and unable to get up. Two crutches will be necessary to get around properly in the future, unless he wants to hop around on one leg. ","An utterly hideous storm of fragments tears across your target’s upper thigh near the hip joint, ripping apart his genitals and laying the thigh open to the bone. The target is helpless with pain and shock for d10 turns, gaining one extra IP as a result of the view of his mangled leg and groin, should he survive. Loss of blood will mean he loses unconsciousness after an additional d10 turns, and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until he does. Only very limited function will remain to the leg afterward, reducing M to 1 and causing all Dodge Blow tests to count as Very Hard (-30%), although he can use crutches as per Bullet Damage to Leg #10. ","A jagged piece of metal lays open your target’s inner thigh, severing the femoral artery. The huge spurts of bright, red blood will cause a cumulative penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, the target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless magically healed or rapidly aided by a pressure bandage, requiring a Very Hard (-30%) Heal test and two full turns, death will occur within another d10 turns. ","A blast of shrapnel blows the leg off at the knee, leaving it hanging by a shred. Your target falls to the ground, helpless and with blood spurting from the stump. Death occurs from loss of blood within d10 turns unless magical healing or a tourniquet, requiring two full turns and someone else’s help, is provided, neither of which will save the leg.

Your opponent is stunned until he can pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test, getting his first attempt at the beginning of his next turn, re-rolling each turn until he succeeds. The pain from the broken bones halves his M and makes all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless properly set with a successful Heal test during the first week, the bones will heal badly, causing a permanent penalty of –1 to M and making all future Dodge Blow tests count as Challenging (-10%). Magical healing will correct this, as well as ignore the time required to heal the bones. ","You break your opponent’s ankle, knocking him to the ground. He is stunned for d10/2 turns and cannot use the leg until the fracture has healed in three weeks. If the ankle is not correctly set with a successful Heal test within the first week, it will heal crookedly and permanently reduce your opponent’s M by -1. ","Your blow pops your opponent’s kneecap, making it stand out like a bump underneath the skin to one side of the knee. This is extremely painful and effectively locks the joint. Your opponent falls to the ground and is stunned for d10 turns, afterward being unable to use the leg and suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests until the kneecap is popped back into place. This requires a successful Heal test, and probably a couple of strong helpers to hold the screaming patient down as the healer performs this very painful manoeuvre. (If your opponent is wearing Plate Leggings, this is an unlikely result and the hit instead counts as #8 above.) ","You slam a powerful blow into the side of your opponent’s knee, bending the knee inwards in a most painful and unnatural manner, popping something inside the joint. Ligaments inside the knee have snapped, making the joint unstable. Your opponent is stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty –10% to all tests for the duration of the combat, as well as suffering a permanent penalty of –2 to M and counting all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) from now on. Only magical healing can restore full function to the leg. ","A brutal kick to your opponent’s groin doubles him over, retching and helpless with pain for d10 turns. In addition, he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to all tests for the duration of the battle and will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or have his testicles ruptured, making him permanently sterile. If your opponent is female or wearing a Plate Breastplate with reasonable groin protection (GM’s call but usually included, at least if part of a full suit of plate), ignore this and simply count your opponent as stunned for d10 turns. ","You manage to dislocate your opponent’s hip and break off a fragment of the part of the pelvic bone forming the “cup” holding the head of the thighbone in place against the pelvis, leaving him screaming in agony on the ground. He’ll have to pass an Average T test or fall unconscious from the pain. If successful, he suffers a penalty of –30% to all tests for the duration of the battle, the penalty reduced by one third per week of rest. Regardless, the leg is useless and will probably never heal properly. M is permanently reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%) from now on. Proper healing will require either two months in traction, lying in bed with the leg held up and stretched by weights, under supervision of someone with the Surgery Talent, or magical healing, the latter counting as a Hard (-20%) spell test due to damage to nerves and small blood vessels supplying the joint. ","You shatter your opponent’s shinbone, fragments spearing through the skin. Your opponent falls to the ground, helpless and blind with pain for d10 turns, then suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Such an open fracture is very serious, almost always resulting in gangrene and infection. He\'ll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer infection within d10 days, causing death in another d10 days unless amputation is performed. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will save his life but the leg will remain useless unless magically healed, which will require a Hard (-20%) spell test due to the mess of bone shards, damaged nerves and blood vessels inside the leg. (If your opponent is wearing Plate Leggings, this result is very unlikely and the hit instead counts as #12 above.)
