They counts as stunned until the end of their next turn. In addition the flopping of the detached portion will be very distracting, causing a penalty of -2 to their WS for 1d4 turns. After the battle and any usual Heal tests, an additional hard (+2 to DC) Heal test can be attempted for the purpose of successfully stitching the two parts of the ear back together. This second test does not restore your W characteristic any further.","(TODO:) Your shot grazes your target’s scalp, causing blood to flow into their eyes, as per Cutting Damage to Head #4.","(TODO:) Your shot tears a furrow along your target’s jaw, exposing white bone and teeth. They is stunned until they can pass either a WP or T test, starting to roll on the turn after their next. The scarring will be unattractive but will not reduce their Fel by any significant margin.","(TODO:) Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, knocks out a couple of teeth, lacerates the tongue and exits through the opposite cheek. Your target will suffer a penalty of -4 to their WS until the arrow is removed, requiring a full action. If attempting it themself, your target must first pass a WP test. Failure simply means the arrow remains. After the arrow is removed, the target will spit blood and teeth but suffer only -2 to their WS for the duration of the battle due to pain and the blood trickling down their throat. The tongue and the holes in their cheeks will heal naturally although they'll suffer a penalty of -4 to any Fel tests requiring speech until their W characteristic is fully restored.","(TODO:) Your shot enters through your target’s neck, burying itself to the fletching. Surprisingly, there is very little blood, the arrow/bolt apparently having missed the major arteries or veins. Until the arrow/bolt is removed all the target’s tests count as hard (+2 to DC). Removal requires either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a very hard (+5 to DC) Ag test. Failure means a major artery was nicked during the removal process and either magical healing or another hard (+2 to DC) Heal test will be required to save them from bleeding to death within 1d6 turns.","(TODO:) Your shot enters your opponent’s cheek near the nose and drives on into the nasal cavity, crumpling the thin walls to the nearby sinus. Your target will be at -4 to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to blood and bone fragments filling their mouth and nose.

Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests.","(TODO:) Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, shattering a couple of upper molars and lodging in the mandibular joint between the upper and lower jaw. Your target can no longer either open or close their mouth properly and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the arrow/bolt is removed, due to extreme pain and the blood filling their mouth. Removal will require a challenging (+1 to DC) Heal test or a very hard (+5 to DC) Ag test, taking three full actions. Failure means the arrow remains and a new test cannot be performed until the next day.","(TODO:) Your shot punctures one of your target’s eyeballs, lodging in the bony orbit and causing a clear gelatinous substance to run down their face.

The target is stunned for 1d6 turns. They must then pass a hard (+2 to DC) T test or fall unconscious. If they passes they will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the end of the battle and must then pass an additional hard (+2 to DC) T test or suffer a lethal infection, making them delirious and helpless within one day, killing them within 1d4 days. A Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection. Survival will reduce their Fel by -4 due to personality changes and they will also gain a random Insanity.","(TODO:) Your shot enters through one eye, penetrating into the brain and knocking your target unconscious. Death ensues within 1d4 turns unless magical healing is provided, counting as a very hard (+5 to DC) spell test. Survival will mean the head of the arrow/bolt remains inside their skull and they will suffer a penalty of -4 to WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel for the rest of their life due to brain damage.","(TODO:) Your shot slams into your target, coming out through the back of their neck. There is a 25% chance the shot went in through the mouth, turning them into a gruesome sight indeed and severing the spinal cord on the way out, otherwise going in through the throat and severing a carotid artery in a gush of blood.

This takes two full actions and requires a successful Heal test or a hard (+2 to DC) Ag test. Failure means the shaft broke but the head of the arrow remains lodged in your target’s ribcage, now instead requiring a successful hard (+2 to DC) Heal test and six full actions to remove.","(TODO:) Your shot pierces your target’s side, penetrating the wall of muscle and entering their abdominal cavity but missing any internal organs. Your target suffers a -4 penalty to their WS until the arrow/bolt is removed, requiring two full actions and a successful Heal test or a challenging (+1 to DC) Ag test. Failure means that the projectile was successfully withdrawn but additional damage was caused, delaying healing, resulting in the target regaining one less W the next time they should have regained one or more W. In addition to delayed healing, the target must pass a hard (+2 to DC) T test or suffer an infection within one day, making them delirious and helpless for 1d6 days. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks into your target’s shoulder (roll 1d6: 1-5 right, 6-10 left) near the neck, barely missing the top of the lung. Due to the discomfort of having an arrow/bolt sticking out of their body, your target suffers a penalty of -4 to their WS when using that arm, until the projectile is removed. Unfortunately, the point is lodged deep underneath the collarbone, requiring six full turns and either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a very hard (+5 to DC) Ag test to avoid puncturing the lung. If this happens, the target suffers a cumulative -1 to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reach zero and expiring within another 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks into the target’s belly, felling them to the ground. The projectile has lacerated the intestines, spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. Your target is stunned, requiring a hard (+2 to DC) WP test to recover from the stunning. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, they'll suffer a penalty of -4 to all tests. Removing the arrow requires three full actions and either a successful Heal test or a challenging (+1 to DC) Ag test. In addition, they must make a very hard (+5 to DC) T test or die from infection in 1d6 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing seals up the lacerations within half that time. Alternatively, a very hard (+5 to DC) Heal test with the Surgery Talent can be attempted, reducing the difficulty level to merely hard (+2 to DC) if a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is first performed.","(TODO:) Your shot sinks deep into your target’s stomach just beneath the ribs on their left side and damages the spleen, causing internal bleeding. They is stunned until the end of their next turn and will then suffer a cumulative penalty of – 5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. In addition, penalties until the projectile is removed and subsequent risk of infection is as for #6 above. Fortunately, the bleeding will be brought to a halt by the tough membranous covering of the spleen, containing the damage before your target dies from loss of blood.","(TODO:) Your shot splits your target’s breastbone but loses momentum before piercing their heart. The intense pain makes your opponent helpless until they can pass a hard (+2 to DC) T test, reducing it to stunning, requiring another test to recover from that. They can start rolling for those tests at the end of their next turn.","(TODO:) Your shot penetrates between your target’s lower ribs, damaging a kidney. The massive bleeding causes a cumulative penalty of -2 to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless magically healed, they will die from loss of blood in another 1d6 turns. If they survives the arrow/bolt will need to be removed as for #6 above.","(TODO:) Your shot penetrates your target’s chest, collapsing one lung. They must pass an immediate hard (+2 to DC) T test to stay conscious, otherwise suffering a penalty of –30% to all tests, and will also suffer a 20% risk of dying each turn, until magical healing is provided. If they survives, the penalty will be reduced by 10% each week as the lung gradually expands again.","(TODO:) Your shot tears through your target’s chest, damaging the aorta where it connects to the heart. The massive loss of blood causes a cumulative penalty of -4 to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, your target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, then also suffering a cumulative 20% chance of dying each turn as their heart futilely empties their system of blood. Only a Very Hard magical healing spell test can save their life.","(TODO:) Your shot tears out through your target’s back, lacerating their liver, severing their abdominal aorta, damaging the spinal cord and felling them helpless to the ground, coughing up blood and bilious fluid.

They also loses use of the arm until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which requires a full action (half an action to break off the head, another to pull the shaft out) either by themself or someone else, plus a successful challenging (+1 to DC) WP test if they does it themself, gritting their teeth against the pain.","(TODO:) Your shot slices the back of your target’s hand, severing tendons and nicking the metacarpal bones between the wrist and fingers. They can still flex their fingers, so they doesn’t drop their weapon, but the distracting sight of twitching tendons and white bone causes a penalty of -4 to their WS until the end of their next turn. Unless magically healed they'll suffer a permanent -2 penalty to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand due to decreased manual dexterity from not being able to open their hand properly.","(TODO:) Your shot transfixes your target’s hand, passing between the metacarpal bones between wrist and fingers, and nailing it to any shield they might be holding in that hand. Until the arrow is removed, as per #5 above, the hand is useless. They also counts as stunned until the end of their next turn and, unless magically healed, will suffer a permanent -1 penalty to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand, due to nerve damage to their middle finger.","(TODO:) Your shot transfixes your target’s wrist, resulting in penalties as for #7 above, except that you must pass a WP test to recover from the stunning and the penalty will be -4 due to the much greater damage to nerves and tendons.","(TODO:) Your shot penetrates your target’s forearm, the point lodging in one of the long bones of the forearm. Your target is stunned for 1d4 turns. The arm is useless until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which is very difficult due to the head being firmly embedded in the bone, requiring three full actions either by you or someone else, plus a successful hard (+2 to DC) WP test if you do it yourself.","(TODO:) Your shot lodges in your target’s elbow, severing the head of one of the long bones of the forearm and jamming the joint at a 90-degree angle.

This requires either a successful Heal test or, if lacking that skill, a hard (+2 to DC) Ag test, by someone else. Failure means the head was successfully withdrawn but additional damage means healing is delayed, the target recovering one less W the next time they should have regained one or more W.","(TODO:) Your shot lacerates the target’s biceps muscle, also severing the large artery in the arm. Due to the spurting arterial spray, they will suffer a cumulative penalty of -2 to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, losing consciousness when any of those characteristics reaches zero. When they wakes up the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn as per #5 above.","(TODO:) Your shot pierces the meaty part of your target’s shoulder near the neck, damaging the brachial plexus, the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm. They must pass a hard (+2 to DC) WP test to avoid dropping whatever they is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder.

They counts as helpless for 1d4 turns and is unable to support themself on that leg until the fracture has healed in six weeks. Hopping on one leg counts as having a Move of 1 and all WS and Dodge Blow tests count as very hard (+5 to DC).

The only effective cure is a procedure called trepanation, which involves removing a piece of the skull by drilling or boring into it, thus relieving the pressure and allowing access to remove the splinter.

If already in a coma, your opponent will then wake up in another 1d4 days, otherwise regaining their lost characteristics at a rate of 5% per day. Failure will still relieve the pressure but causes brain damage, reducing WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel by -2 permanently.

Your target’s M will be reduced to 1 as they hobbles along, counting any Dodge Blow tests as very hard (+5 to DC) until the end of the battle.

They falls to the ground, screaming and stunned for 1d6 turns. Unless magical healing is provided within 1d6 days, the leg will have to be amputated. Otherwise it’ll still be stiff and unbending, causing permanent penalties as per #8 above.","(TODO:) A large piece of shrapnel pierces your target’s thigh, tearing out of the back of the leg in a spray of blood, leaving a huge flap of muscle gruesomely flapping. The blast knocks them to the ground, unable to get up. Loss of blood will cause a cumulative -1 to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, the target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Unless the leg is tightly bandaged, requiring someone else’s help and three full turns, death will occur within another 2d10 turns.","(TODO:) Fragments tear into the hip joint, causing nerve damage that leaves the whole leg limp and useless, totally paralysed.

Two crutches will be necessary to get around properly in the future, unless they wants to hop around on one leg.","(TODO:) An utterly hideous storm of fragments tears across your target’s upper thigh near the hip joint, ripping apart their genitals and laying the thigh open to the bone. The target is helpless with pain and shock for 1d6 turns, gaining one extra IP as a result of the view of their mangled leg and groin, should they survive. Loss of blood will mean they loses unconsciousness after an additional 1d6 turns, and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until they does. Only very limited function will remain to the leg afterward, reducing M to 1 and causing all Dodge Blow tests to count as very hard (+5 to DC), although they can use crutches as per Bullet Damage to Leg #10.","(TODO:) A jagged piece of metal lays open your target’s inner thigh, severing the femoral artery. The huge spurts of bright, red blood will cause a cumulative penalty of -2 to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, the target falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero.

Your opponent is stunned until they can pass a challenging (+1 to DC) WP test, getting their first attempt at the beginning of their next turn, re-rolling each turn until they succeeds. The pain from the broken bones halves their M and makes all Dodge Blow tests count as hard (+2 to DC) until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless properly set with a successful Heal test during the first week, the bones will heal badly, causing a permanent penalty of –1 to M and making all future Dodge Blow tests count as challenging (+1 to DC). Magical healing will correct this, as well as ignore the time required to heal the bones.","(TODO:) You break your opponent’s ankle, knocking them to the ground.

This is extremely painful and effectively locks the joint. Your opponent falls to the ground and is stunned for 1d6 turns, afterward being unable to use the leg and suffering a penalty of -4 to all tests until the kneecap is popped back into place. This requires a successful Heal test, and probably a couple of strong helpers to hold the screaming patient down as the healer performs this very painful manoeuvre.

","(TODO:) You slam a powerful blow into the side of your opponent’s knee, bending the knee inwards in a most painful and unnatural manner, popping something inside the joint. Ligaments inside the knee have snapped, making the joint unstable. Your opponent is stunned for 1d4 turns and then suffers a penalty -2 to all tests for the duration of the combat, as well as suffering a permanent penalty of –2 to M and counting all Dodge Blow tests as hard (+2 to DC) from now on.

In addition, they'll suffer a penalty of -2 to all tests for the duration of the battle and will have to pass a challenging (+1 to DC) T test or have their testicles ruptured, making them permanently sterile. If your opponent is female or wearing a Plate Breastplate with reasonable groin protection (GM’s call but usually included, at least if part of a full suit of plate), ignore this and simply count your opponent as stunned for 1d6 turns.","(TODO:) You manage to dislocate your opponent’s hip and break off a fragment of the part of the pelvic bone forming the “cup” holding the head of the thighbone in place against the pelvis, leaving them screaming in agony on the ground. He’ll have to pass an regular T test or fall unconscious from the pain. If successful, they suffers a penalty of –30% to all tests for the duration of the battle, the penalty reduced by one third per week of rest. Regardless, the leg is useless and will probably never heal properly. M is permanently reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as very hard (+5 to DC) from now on. Proper healing will require either two months in traction, lying in bed with the leg held up and stretched by weights, under supervision of someone with the Surgery Talent, or magical healing, the latter counting as a hard (+2 to DC) spell test due to damage to nerves and small blood vessels supplying the joint.","(TODO:) You shatter your opponent’s shinbone, fragments spearing through the skin. Your opponent falls to the ground, helpless and blind with pain for 1d6 turns, then suffering a penalty of -4 to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Such an open fracture is very serious, almost always resulting in gangrene and infection. They'll have to pass a hard (+2 to DC) T test or suffer infection within 1d6 days, causing death in another 1d6 days unless amputation is performed. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will save their life but the leg will remain useless unless magically healed, which will require a hard (+2 to DC) spell test due to the mess of bone shards, damaged nerves and blood vessels inside the leg.

shot nicks your target’s ear, causing a –10% penalty to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot grazes your target’s cheek, slicing open a wound that bleeds far more freely than expected. He’ll lose one attack or free parry on his next turn as he clasps one hand to his face. ","Your shot grazes your target’s neck, causing him to flinch and suffer a penalty of –20% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","Your shot slashes across your target’s ear, almost entirely severing the top third. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn. In addition the flopping of the detached portion will be very distracting, causing a penalty of –10% to his WS for d10/2 turns. After the battle and any usual Heal tests, an additional Hard (-20%) Heal test can be attempted for the purpose of successfully stitching the two parts of the ear back together. This second test does not restore your W characteristic any further. ","Your shot grazes your target’s scalp, causing blood to flow into his eyes, as per Cutting Damage to Head #4. ","Your shot tears a furrow along your target’s jaw, exposing white bone and teeth. He is stunned until he can pass either a WP or T test, starting to roll on the turn after his next. The scarring will be unattractive but will not reduce his Fel by any significant margin. ","Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, knocks out a couple of teeth, lacerates the tongue and exits through the opposite cheek. Your target will suffer a penalty of –20% to his WS until the arrow is removed, requiring a full action. If attempting it himself, your target must first pass a WP test. Failure simply means the arrow remains. After the arrow is removed, the target will spit blood and teeth but suffer only –10% to his WS for the duration of the battle due to pain and the blood trickling down his throat. The tongue and the holes in his cheeks will heal naturally although he’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to any Fel tests requiring speech until his W characteristic is fully restored. ","Your shot enters through your target’s neck, burying itself to the fletching. Surprisingly, there is very little blood, the arrow/bolt apparently having missed the major arteries or veins. Until the arrow/bolt is removed all the target’s tests count as Hard (-20%). Removal requires either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test. Failure means a major artery was nicked during the removal process and either magical healing or another Hard (-20%) Heal test will be required to save him from bleeding to death within d10 turns. ","Your shot enters your opponent’s cheek near the nose and drives on into the nasal cavity, crumpling the thin walls to the nearby sinus. Your target will be at –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to blood and bone fragments filling his mouth and nose. He is also stunned for d10 turns and must pass a WP test or gain one IP extra due to the horrifying experience of seeing an arrow sticking from his face. Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests. ","Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, shattering a couple of upper molars and lodging in the mandibular joint between the upper and lower jaw. Your target can no longer either open or close his mouth properly and will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the arrow/bolt is removed, due to extreme pain and the blood filling his mouth. Removal will require a Challenging (-10%) Heal test or a Very Hard (-30%) Ag test, taking three full actions. Failure means the arrow remains and a new test cannot be performed until the next day. ","Your shot punctures one of your target’s eyeballs, lodging in the bony orbit and causing a clear gelatinous substance to run down his face. The target is stunned until the end of the battle. No amount of mundane or magical healing can restore the eye and he suffers reduction of any BS or sightbased Perception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter. ","Your shot pierces your target’s forehead, penetrating the skull by about an inch or two and damaging one frontal lobe of the brain. The target is stunned for d10 turns. He must then pass a Hard (-20%) T test or fall unconscious. If he passes he will suffer a penalty of –30% to all tests until the end of the battle and must then pass an additional Hard (-20%) T test or suffer a lethal infection, making him delirious and helpless within one day, killing him within d10/2 days. A Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection. Survival will reduce his Fel by –20% due to personality changes and he will also gain a random Insanity.

He also loses use of the arm until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which requires a full action (half an action to break off the head, another to pull the shaft out) either by himself or someone else, plus a successful Challenging (-10%) WP test if he does it himself, gritting his teeth against the pain. ","Your shot slices the back of your target’s hand, severing tendons and nicking the metacarpal bones between the wrist and fingers. He can still flex his fingers, so he doesn’t drop his weapon, but the distracting sight of twitching tendons and white bone causes a penalty of – 20% to his WS until the end of his next turn.

Your opponent must make a Challenging (-10%) WP test or gain one extra IP as he realizes what has happened. He will suffer a penalty of –20% to all actions for the rest of the battle. Fortunately, urine is more or less sterile, meaning he will only have to make a Challenging (-10%) T test to avoid contracting a lethal infection as for #7 above.

Such a wound inevitably causes a severe infection and hardly any amount of mundane healing in the Old World can repair such damage, the victim usually dying within d10/2 days. Should an attempt at Heal with the Surgery Talent be made it will count as Very Hard (-30%) and even if the surgeon is successful your opponent must still pass a Very Hard (-30%) T test or succumb to infection anyway. Any successful magical healing attempt will take care of the infection as well but will also be counted as Very Hard (-30%) unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell has first been performed, in which case it merely counts as Challenging (-10%).

If successful, he’ll suffer no further ill effects. ","You savagely slam your fist or knee repeatedly against your opponent’s side over and over again, breaking several of his ribs and contusing the lung. He falls to the ground, spitting blood, helpless until the end of his next turn, all breath driven from his body. He then suffers a penalty of –20% to all actions for the duration of the combat. After the battle he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS, BS, Ag and S from Critical Hits – Unarmed Combat Damage the pain of fractured ribs grinding against each other, until his W characteristic is fully restored as his ribs slowly heal. ","You fracture several of the lower ribs on your opponent’s right side, the sharp fragments driving into his body and lacerating his liver. He is stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty of –15% to all actions for the duration of the combat. He’ll also have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or suffer serious internal bleeding. If successful, he’ll only suffer a penalty of –10% to WS, BS, Ag and S from the pain of fractured ribs grinding against each other, until his W characteristic is fully restored as his ribs slowly heal. Otherwise he’ll also suffer an additional cumulative penalty of an extra –5% per hour after the battle, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Fortunately, the bleeding will stop spontaneously thereafter and he’ll regain his characteristics at a rate of 10% per day (not counting the –10% penalty from the pain of the broken ribs) as his body replenishes the lost blood. ","A vicious blow to your opponent’s left side stuns him until the end of his next turn and ruptures his spleen. The longerterm results are as for Blunt Damage to Body #6. ","You pick your opponent up bodily and slam him into the ground. He’ll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or be knocked unconscious. If successful, he’ll count as knocked down and stunned for d10/2 turns. If the GM judges that this result is unlikely, even with the extra strength brought on by a surge of adrenaline, such as if your opponent is an Ogre or otherwise severely outweighs you, your opponent nevertheless still is thrown badly off balance and ends up on the floor, knocked down and counting as stunned for d10/2 turns. ","You slam either your fist or the heel of your foot into the upper part of your opponent's solar plexus, snapping the lower part of his breastbone. The fragment drives into his chest, lacerating the diaphragm muscles that he breathes with. He falls helplessly to his knees, gasping and helpless for d10 turns until he keels over unconscious. He'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or die in another 2d10 turns, otherwise suffering a permanent reduction of -15% to S and T due to reduced breathing capacity. If your opponent is wearing a breastplate he is instead hurled backwards, hitting his head as he lands, laying him out cold but otherwise very much alive and unhurt. ","You grab you opponent and with irresistible force slam him down on his back across your knee, breaking his spine. He must pass an immediate Very Hard (-30%) T test or die on the spot, otherwise becoming permanently paralysed from the waist down and counting as helpless from shock for the duration of the combat. If your opponent is wearing a Plate Breastplate with a backplate (GM's call but usually included, especially if part of a full suit of plate), then you would not be so foolish as to attempt this stunt and end up with a broken knee; count the result as #13 instead. "],Arms:["You manage to momentarily grab your opponent’s arm, making him lose one attack or free parry during his next turn before slipping out of your grasp. ","You slam a fist into your opponent’s shoulder, shocking his arm, causing him to suffer a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","You bruise your opponent’s upper arm, causing him to flinch. He may not perform any attack actions on his next turn. ","You manage to grab whatever your opponent is holding in that hand. Make an opposed S test, your opponent gaining a +20% bonus to his S if he is holding a shield or a twohanded weapon. If you beat him you have snatched it away and are now in possession of it. Weapons that are mostly blade, such as swords or knives, are much harder to grab, requiring a successful Hard (-20%) Ag test first. If you fail, or if your opponent is holding nothing in that hand, the result is as per #1 above. ","You slam an elbow, fist or booted foot into your opponent’s biceps, bruising the muscle, causing a penalty of –10% to his WS and S for any tests or blows using that arm for the duration of the combat. ","You manage to grab and badly twist your opponent’s wrist, making him drop whatever he is holding in that hand. If he is holding nothing, then he is unable to use that hand for attacking and may not attempt to grapple for the next two turns. ","You smack your opponent in the elbow, hitting a nerve, sending a shock of sharp pain down the arm, making him drop anything held in that hand. He’ll have to pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or be stunned until the end of his next turn. The arm is paralysed and useless for d10/2 turns. ","You get hold of one of your opponent’s fingers, bending it backward savagely until the bone snaps. Your opponent counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and must pass a WP test each time he wants to perform any action with that hand for the duration of the battle. Setting the finger straight again and tying it to a small splint or a neighbouring finger is painful but easy, but your opponent will still suffer a penalty of –10% to any tasks, attacks or parries due to pain and swelling until the bone has started to heal properly in two weeks. ","You hit your opponent’s hand, fracturing a couple of the metacarpals, the bones between wrist and fingers, a classical “boxer’s fracture” usually caused by punching something hard. The hand is useless until the bones have started healing properly in two weeks. ","You slam your opponent in the junction between neck and shoulder with a vicious chop, breaking the collarbone. Your opponent is stunned until the end of his next turn and then suffers a penalty of –20% to any tests made with that arm until the fracture has healed in three weeks. ","You smash your opponent with a mighty blow, dislocating the shoulder from its socket. Your opponent is stunned until he can pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test, getting one attempt at the beginning of each of his turns. The whole arm is useless until popped back into place with a successful Heal test, afterward suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests performed with that arm until it has started to heal in one week, halving the penalty for another week before being restored to full function. ","You snap your opponent’s wrist, making the hand stand out at an odd angle. He must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or be stunned for d10/2 turns. The hand is useless until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless the wrist has been properly set with a successful Heal test within the first week, he will then suffer a penalty of -10% to WS tests or tests requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand afterward due to improperly set bones. Magical healing will automatically do this, as well as speeding up the healing process, ignoring the month required. ","You lock your opponent’s arm in a strong grip and then either twist it forcefully or bring up a knee to slam into the elbow joint, snapping the elbow with a loud crack. Your opponent is stunned for d10/2 turns and the arm useless until the fracture has healed in four weeks. ","You grab your opponent’s arm and twist around, throwing him across your hip. He lands heavily, knocked down and stunned for d10 turns. His shoulder is also dislocated as per #11 above. ","As your opponent swings at you, you grab his arm and use his momentum to drag him toward you, and then roll backward as you put a foot in his stomach, hurling him over your head. He must pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test or break his neck as he lands, killing him. If he passes he is still knocked unconscious. If the GM judges that such a throw is completely unlikely, such as if he very considerably outweighs you, or has a very low centre of gravity (think Dwarf in plate!), or your legs are crippled, then you instead manage to get him so off balance that he is still hurled to the ground and knocked unconscious, perhaps tripping him up as he stumbles past you. "],Legs:["A glancing blow hits your opponent’s shin, the pain causing a penalty of –10% to his WS until the end of his next turn. ","You strike your opponent on the inside of his thigh, barely missing his groin. He is knocked off balance and may not perform any attack actions on his next turn. ","A vicious blow against your opponent’s hip fails to break anything but causes him enough pain to reduce his WS by – 20% until the end of his next turn. ","You stomp down hard on your opponent’s toes. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn as he jumps up and down, wailing and cursing. ","You sweep your opponent’s leg, knocking him to the ground unless he can pass a Hard (-20%) Ag test. If successful, he may not perform any attack actions on his next turn. ","A powerful blow slams into your opponent’s hip, spinning him around and knocking him to the ground, dazed and stunned until the end of his next turn. ","You badly bruise your opponent’s thigh. He suffers a penalty of –1 to his M and counts all Dodge Blow tests as Challenging (-10%) for the duration of the battle. ","You strike a telling blow to your opponent’s knee. He must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or count as stunned for d10/2 turns. If successful, his M is halved and he counts all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) for an equal amount of time. ","You slam your heel down hard on your opponent’s foot, breaking some of the metatarsals, the bones between the ankle and the toes. Your opponent is stunned until he can pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test, getting his first attempt at the beginning of his next turn, re-rolling each turn until he succeeds. The pain from the broken bones halves his M and makes all Dodge Blow tests count as Hard (-20%) until the bones have healed in three weeks. Unless properly set with a successful Heal test during the first week, the bones will heal badly, causing a permanent penalty of –1 to M and making all future Dodge Blow tests count as Challenging (-10%). Magical healing will correct this, as well as ignore the time required to heal the bones. ","You break your opponent’s ankle, knocking him to the ground. He is stunned for d10/2 turns and cannot use the leg until the fracture has healed in three weeks. If the ankle is not correctly set with a successful Heal test within the first week, it will heal crookedly and permanently reduce your opponent’s M by -1. ","Your blow pops your opponent’s kneecap, making it stand out like a bump underneath the skin to one side of the knee. This is extremely painful and effectively locks the joint. Your opponent falls to the ground and is stunned for d10 turns, afterward being unable to use the leg and suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests until the kneecap is popped back into place. This requires a successful Heal test, and probably a couple of strong helpers to hold the screaming patient down as the healer performs this very painful manoeuvre. (If your opponent is wearing Plate Leggings, this is an unlikely result and the hit instead counts as #8 above.) ","You slam a powerful blow into the side of your opponent’s knee, bending the knee inwards in a most painful and unnatural manner, popping something inside the joint. Ligaments inside the knee have snapped, making the joint unstable. Your opponent is stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty –10% to all tests for the duration of the combat, as well as suffering a permanent penalty of –2 to M and counting all Dodge Blow tests as Hard (-20%) from now on. Only magical healing can restore full function to the leg. ","A brutal kick to your opponent’s groin doubles him over, retching and helpless with pain for d10 turns. In addition, he’ll suffer a penalty of –10% to all tests for the duration of the battle and will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or have his testicles ruptured, making him permanently sterile. If your opponent is female or wearing a Plate Breastplate with reasonable groin protection (GM’s call but usually included, at least if part of a full suit of plate), ignore this and simply count your opponent as stunned for d10 turns. ","You manage to dislocate your opponent’s hip and break off a fragment of the part of the pelvic bone forming the “cup” holding the head of the thighbone in place against the pelvis, leaving him screaming in agony on the ground. He’ll have to pass an Average T test or fall unconscious from the pain. If successful, he suffers a penalty of –30% to all tests for the duration of the battle, the penalty reduced by one third per week of rest. Regardless, the leg is useless and will probably never heal properly. M is permanently reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as Very Hard (-30%) from now on. Proper healing will require either two months in traction, lying in bed with the leg held up and stretched by weights, under supervision of someone with the Surgery Talent, or magical healing, the latter counting as a Hard (-20%) spell test due to damage to nerves and small blood vessels supplying the joint. ","You shatter your opponent’s shinbone, fragments spearing through the skin. Your opponent falls to the ground, helpless and blind with pain for d10 turns, then suffering a penalty of –20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Such an open fracture is very serious, almost always resulting in gangrene and infection. He'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or suffer infection within d10 days, causing death in another d10 days unless amputation is performed. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will save his life but the leg will remain useless unless magically healed, which will require a Hard (-20%) spell test due to the mess of bone shards, damaged nerves and blood vessels inside the leg. (If your opponent is wearing Plate Leggings, this result is very unlikely and the hit instead counts as #12 above.)
