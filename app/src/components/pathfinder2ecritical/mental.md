# Mental damage

8 "(TODO:) Your blow crashes into your opponent's skull, stunning them until the end of their next turn. On their next turn after that they must pass a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save to recover, rerolling each turn until they succeeds. The blow has fractured their skull, causing a splinter of bone to press into their brain and starting a slow bleeding between the brain and the skull that will keep expanding, eventually killing them unless pressure is relieved. They'll suffer a cumulative penalty of -1 to their attack rolls, attack rolls, Ag, Int and Fel every two hours, falling into a coma when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying within another 1d4 days. The only effective cure is a procedure called trepanation, which involves removing a piece of the skull by drilling or boring into it, thus relieving the pressure and allowing access to remove the splinter. This requires at least one hour and a challenging (+1 to DC) Medicine check with expert proficiency. If successful, a metal plate of some kind, usually a silver coin that has been hammeredremovenailed directly to the surrounding bone and then covered with a flap of the scalp. If already in a coma, your opponent will then wake up in another 1d4 days, otherwise regaining their lost characteristics at a rate of 5% per day. Failure will still relieve the pressure but causes brain damage, reducing attack rolls, attack rolls, Ag, Int and Fel by -2 permanently. Regardless of outcome, your opponent will have to pass a challenging (+1 to DC) Fortitude save immediately after the surgery or contract a serious infection, killing them within 1d6 days unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is performed.",
9 "(TODO:) A jet of flame burns your target's scalp to the bone, forcing them to pass a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or pass out from heat-shock to the brain. They'll suffer a penalty of -4 to all tests for 2d10 turns, due to pain and dizziness. After the battle, the loss of skin results in serious risk of infection. They'll have to pass an regular Fortitude save or suffer an infection that will leave them helpless and delirious for 1d6 days, whereupon they'll have to make another test to either recover or die. A Shallyan Cure Disease spell will deal with any infection. Because of the exposed bone and the skin not being able to grow back over it properly, any time the target is exposed to sources of contamination (such as walking through a swamp or sleeping in a dirty barn), the GM might force them to repeat those tests. Magical healing will let the skin grow back, preventing this."
12. A piece of the target's brain melts making target suffer short-time seizure. Your target is knocked prone and must pass a challenging (+1 to DC) Fortitude save or be stunned. After the battle they must make a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or suffer an acute inflammation of the brain, killing them in 1d4 days unless saved by a successful cure disease.
13. Extreme pain causing bleeding inside target's brain. They fall immediately tearing their face before becoming stunned and remain in a coma for 1d6 days. Afterward they must pass a challenging (+1 to DC) Fortitude save or die. Survival will mean the permanent brain-damage and they will suffer a penalty of -1 to all skill checks for the rest of their life due to brain damage unless it's recovered with powerful restoration or regeneration magic.
14. The pain engulfs your target's head, boiling their brain within their skull. Screams are slowly calms as the target is inevitably dead within one turn.
15. Whole brain of your target liquifies. They are dead almost before hitting the ground, and most definitely when they do, as most of their brain sloshed out of their brainpan through nose and ears.
