### Cutting Head 4

The flow of blood into their eyes will cause a dazzled condition until they spend an action to wipe it away. Each turn after that they must attempt a DC 6 flat check or more blood will flow down, repeating the condition, possibly occurring again and again until somebody pass very easy (-5 to DC) Administer First Aid check to bandage the wound.

### Cutting Head 6

Until they has two successful Administer First Aid Medicine checks performed on them, they must, after a number of turns equal to their Constitutions modifier (minimum 1), start passing a routine (-1 to DC) Fortitude save each turn, falling stunned from loss of blood if they fails.

### Cutting Head 8

Your weapon slices off your opponent's nose as they bends backward in an attempt to dodge your blow. They counts as slowed 2 until the end of their next turn. A prosthetic nose can be made.

### Cutting Damage to Body #7

Your opponent must make a hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or be slowed 2 for 1d4 turns. In addition, they must make a very hard (+5 to DC) Fortitude save or die from infection in 1d6 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day). Curing DC is also very hard as this involves a very risky surgical procedure, digging deep into the abdomen, stitching up the holes and cleaning out any gall or other foul substances visible.

### Cutting Damage to Body #9

With a faint odour of ammonia, urine spills from the wound and onto your blade. They become sickened 4 for the rest of the battle. Fortunately, urine is more or less sterile, meaning they will only have to make a challenging (+1 to DC) Fortitude save to avoid contracting a lethal infection and die in 1d6 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day). If they survives they must make a challenging (+1 to DC) Fortitude save or be prone to leakage and constantly reek of urine.

### Cutting Damage to Body #11

Your weapon deeply penetrates your opponent's belly, badly lacerating both the small and large intestine, spilling faecal matter into the abdominal cavity. They'll have to make an immediate challenging (+1 to DC) Fortitude save or fall stunned. If successful they'll still be sickened 4 due to pain and shock for the duration of the combat. Such a wound inevitably causes a severe infection and hardly any amount of mundane healing can repair such damage, the victim usually dying within 1d4 days. Should an attempt at Medicine with expert proficiency be made it will count as very hard (+5 to DC) and even if the surgeon is successful your your opponent must still pass a very hard (+5 to DC) Fortitude save or succumb to infection anyway. Any successful magical healing attempt will take care of the infection as well but will also be counted as hard (+2 to DC).

### Cutting Damage to Body #12

Your weapon opens your opponentâ€™s abdomen, spilling their entrails about their feet. They'll suffer a cumulative sickened 2 and drained 2 conditions each turn until they pass hard (+2 to DC) Fortitude save or die in 1d6 turns. Until that time your opponent can do nothing except futilely try to stuff the spilt entrails back into their ruined abdomen and counted as stunned. Anyone surviving such a horrifying experience must pass basic Will save or become frightened 1.

### Cutting Damage to Leg #7

Your weapon severs large muscles at the back of your opponent's thigh. They falls to the ground and become flat-footed. This penalty remains permanently unless someone passes a challenging (+1 to DC) Medicine check with expert proficiency before the target has healed themselves in 1d6 days to remove of the tendons and muscles have shrivelled and contracted so much that successful surgery or healing is impossible.

### Cutting Damage to Leg #9

For the duration of the battle they will be sickened 2 due to severe pain, and they will suffer a penalty of 10 feet to their movement and -1 to AC from now on. Only master surgeon can restore the kneecap's function.

### Cutting Damage to Leg #13

Your weapon cleanly severs your opponent's leg at the knee, causing them to fall to the ground, stunned, and die from loss of blood in 1d6 turns unless a hard (+2 to DC) Medicine check stops the bleeding. If they survives, they'll need crutches or a prosthetic foot, reducing movement to 10 feet and making them flat-footed.
